For some reason my hair hates hard water more than most people (we have hard well water, and although the rest of my family noticed their hair was a little less healthy looking, mine looked and felt DISGUSTING because I just could not get the minerals out of my hair, and continuing to wash it only made it worse). This is the only shampoo/conditioner combo that fixed that problem. I had even tried an expensive hard water shampoo that didn't work nearly as well. Even if you don't have hard water issues, this shampoo really made my hair feel lighter and way more voluminous. Everyone's hair is different, but I definitely recommend at least giving this one a try!\n",

This is great - I carry it around with me and spray everybody, even if they're dripping. You can see this bead up the moisture on the skin, so you know it's not rinsing off. We all tan like crazy, so we don't use this to prevent sunburn, but it seems to stop us from getting too tan and it keeps our skin soft.

However, there was one really bad thing about this shampoo + conditioner, and it's the conditioner!!! It stinks!! It literally smells like rotten wet dog, it is so atrocious. Luckily the scent doesn't last long after you get out of the shower, but it makes the washing experience feel dirty. The shampoo smells good, but that conditioner...who thought of that scent\n",

      "In spite of having lots of suction, unit is poor at \"edge\" cleaning. This replaces a very heavy upright, so the lighter weight is a big plus. There is no height adjustment for carpeting, so is difficult to use on shag. On shag one must raise the unit to move forward and pull back across carpet.Pushing unit forward on shag Very difficult. The canister works very well.Lots of power.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "Bought the vacuum because of weight of our previous one...was very difficult for my wife to carry it upstairs. This one is very light and the suction is tremendous. However, our bedroom carpet is deep and plush. The self adjusting feature doesn't adjust enough for this type carpet. The machine is very hard to push on the carpet, and the brush and wheels leave deep tracks. We have to rake the carpet after vacuuming. I recommend the vacuum if your carpet is not the deep and plush variety.\n",

      "The Bad such as it is, is that the Porta Power canister vac hasn't had much visible evolution over the years, other than to get rid of the gaskets inside the end of the wand. (Actually, that's a big plus! - I used to have a commercial Porta Power and that gasket gave me fits.) Now for the Good. No more getting dust in the face when emptying the vacuum cleaner. I used to have a Dyson Animal, and while not needing bags was nice, it was all but impossible to not get a cloud of dust when emptying it. Two other big pluses over the Dyson are that the Platinum's head is thinner, so I can get further under funiture, and by switching to low suction, I can do area rugs that were completely impossible with the Dyson.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "I bought this vacuum because it is lightweight and bagged. I love it. Totally. But the included cannister has serious issues: the floor brush won't stay on the wand without duct tape(!) the upholstry brush is useless--very small and the dusting brush is non-existent (some strange thing you fit onto the upholstry brush). What was Hoover thinking I still have to use my old cannister vacuum to handle upholstry, stairs and furniture dusting. What a disappointment.\n",

I do wish I would have went with the ORECK!\n",

You can easily spend $500 for a Oreck Vacuum that has these same features - but save your money, this Hoover is all you need.My son has a terrible dust mite allergy, we notice a difference already in his breathing due to b- weekly cleaning with our Hoover.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "Believe it or not, way less messy to empty and clean than those bagless vaccum cleaners. I had one before this that I practically needed a mask to empty... And if I tried to do indoors, I would have to vaccum again... This problem does not happen with this product.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "For those of you who need a review to consider buying this, here it is:I have been using this vacuum for about a month now and absolutely love it. The suction is great.....no complaints there. Sorry I waited so long to buy it. I used to have a Dyson, but it was so heavy, and I always had to dump the canister which would cause the dust to go back into the air, and it would not reach under things due to its size. I use this vac almost everyday due to 3 cats and 1 dog, and am just amazed by how well it picks up all the hair. Sure, you have to buy bags, but at least you won't get all the dust flying around as you would with the bagless vacs.I got the canister vac with this, but really don't use it unless doing under cushions. I have had no problems with this vacuum picking up all the dirt, etc. along the bottom of the baseboads.....it gets it all.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "I read all the reviews and was hesitant to purchase such an expensive vacuum cleaner but one of the things I needed was something that was good at picking up dog hair on both carpeted and hardwood floors. I decided to try this since it got no bad reviews and WOW! I have never ever had a vacuum cleaner that had such suction and power. I was so amazed at how easily it moved due to the \"self-propelled\" mechanism.The only improvement would be to have some attachments on board so when you are vacuuming a room you could quickly do corners, etc., but then it probably would take away from the suction power! The little vacuum is very convenient for little jobs and it will work for when I need the attachments.One thing that I never saw in any of the reviews I read is that the vacuum cleaner bags are self-sealing. That means that when you remove them from the vacuum cleaner, they automatically seal so no dust or particles escape into the air. I always hated that when I had to re-vacuum after removing a bag. The bags are very thick and high quality so it's no wonder they are expensive.If you are debating about this one and you're on the edge, just take the plunge. You won't be disappointed!\n",

      "I have been using Lip Shimmers for a few years now. My favorite color is Rhubarb-because it adds just the right amount of color-not too much, not too little. I also like this product because for me-it has an extra added health benefit. I have a tendency to get cold sores-and since using Lip Shimmers(which have all sorts of wonderful herbal ingredients) cold sores have rarely made an appearrance. It also doesn't taste or smell to bad like some lipsticks. The only thing i don't like about it-is that it doesn't last long enough!!\n",

      "-------\n",
      "It has just the right amount of color and beautiful shimmer for a glow rather than glitter mess. I was a bit apprehensive due to some horrific views, but newbies should ignore them and go and get some! I read stories of them drying out the lips or too much shimmer. Yes, there is noticeable shimmer but it only adds another dimension to the lippie. I got the lip trio of peony, fig, and champagne. Peony is like a pink bronzy or frosted color while fig is a no shimmer berry color. Champagne is a baby pink frost color but the shimmer is not overwhelming, believe me (I am African American and these colors still look flattering on me). So, if you are still a bit hesitant about the shimmer, try fig or plum which have no shimmer. By the way, the minty feel and smell is a bonus since it will freshen your breath while adding a smoothing feel to the lips.\n",

I've wasted money on two other colors, trying to find something else I like, with no success. I thought I must have been part of a small minority of people who really loved this shade. But now after seeing all the reviews, I see that I AM NOT ALONE!!! When it was discontinued, I purchased a few tubes from somebody on eBay. Now the eBay sharks are charging CRAZY amounts of for it - not that I can blame them. It's the law of supply of demand. Why doesn't Burt's Bees want our business Clearly there were A LOT of us buying this shade. Please, please hear our pleas and bring back Cocoa.\n",

Please please bring it back and I will buy 10 at a time just so I will have that color. Companies do this all the time and I don't understand why they do this when the product is selling well.

As an African-American, I think there is a market for a Grecian style formula that works on our hair which requires no coloring at all. Grecian claims it works on all hair but it does not.\n",

It's actually funny that the packaging still looks the same as the ones I remember in my grandmother's dressing area as a child. Unfortunately, it is very hard to find now, which makes me nervous that Coty might discontinue making this. I PRAY NOT! I have never worn liquid foundation and don't know what I'd do if this product was not available to purchase. I searched ULTA for anything comparable and you can find loose powder in about a quarter of an ounce container for 20! I may be exaggerating a tad, but you get the picture.

Images of stained shirts and white flakes all over my clothing is what came to mind before last week! For the past week I've been using Axe Phoenix anti-perspirant deodorant. I have to say, I love this! The deodorant formula, as well as the scent, is light, but lasts all day. The only problem is the deodorant itself tends to cake on the case/packaging after applying it, which can make a mess if you don't wipe it off before it dries. There's no flaking, or staining after application, or after a long day. All you need is a few strokes under each arm, and you are ready for the day. I run everyday, and this deodorant has not let me down! This review was collected as part of a promotion.\n",

It brought my extremely dry, flaky, painful lips back to life after moving to a dry, cold climate that was an extreme shock to my skin. I now use it before exercising in the winter air, before showering, etc., to prevent dry lips to begin with. It's genuinely the best product I've ever used to moisturize or protect my lips. But I can't give it 5 out of 5 because I really dislike having to dip my fingers into the jar so very much - and a makeup brush is annoying in the house and entirely impractical outside of the house.\n",

This instantly soothed my lips, and it's kinda funny, but I put it on the tip of my nose and upper lip too, and now my nose is almost completely healed! I tried everything to soothe my poor nose before, and the alcohol content of other creams burn! After two days it's a 360 transformation! This stuff is the bomb!\n",

This year I wanted to get ahead of it and get chapstick before my lips got bad. Vaseline lip therapy Cocoa butter caught my attention, I absolutely LOVE IT! My lips haven't chapped AT ALL which is a blessing. I don't have to contenuassly apply it so that's always a plus and the smell and feel of it is lovely. Before I found this my lips became painfully chapped and embarrassing. I hated to kiss my husband cause of how they felt and looked. Now thanx to this product I havent have that problem. I NEVER EVER write reviews especially this long HAHA but I assure you this product is amazing.\n",

As soon as I received the box in the mail I put it on right away and I've been reapplying ever since.

Recently, I saw my dermatologist because my face was AWFUL (breaking out, itchy, cracking, etc)... turns out, I had angular cheilitis, oral thrush, AND perioral dermatitis. What the heck! My doctor told me that most lip products further irritate the condition because of all the additives, so he recommended Vaseline. I tried the regular Vaseline, but it was too runny for me... but the Cocoa Butter Vaseline... WOW!! It applies thicker than the regular variety and soothes my irritated lips.\n",

Since I've started using the Head Shoulders Shampoo Conditioners though, I have noticed an improvement of the look of my hair plus I no longer have an itch, dry scalp. I do feel as if the conditioner helps my hair look nicer longer, but not sure what it is doing for my scalp. But either way it's working. I was concerned how similar the conditioner bottle looked to the shampoo. Without my glasses, I was worried I wouldn't know which was which, since the designs are just opposites of the other. So far though, this hasn't been a problem. This review was collected as part of a promotion.\n",

I have faith that my hair will not dry out, and that the conditioner will work with Head Shoulder's shampoo to fight any dandruff. This review was collected as part of a promotion.\n",

The blower is mostly unused, if you crack the door just a bit, the airflow from the evacuation-by-fire is more than enough to stoke the stove.\n",

This seems like a bad combination and as expected broken up pretty well and one bag was actually opened due to this and I won't eat because I'm not sure if safe. So, that sounds bad, but while broken up, what are left are very fresh and not too bad for a several thousand mile trip. Overall very happy, haven't seen a tortilla chip in 2 months!!\n",

Despite other reviews she did not scratch any once applied, my only complaint is that it clumps and cakes up whether I use a thin layer/thick layer/well rubbed in.

      "Nobody likes a sleepless night! A stuffy nose can wake you up which can be a double threat. If you can't sleep it weakens your immunities. Next thing you know, you have a cold, a headache, or you're exhausted the next day. Dab a small amount of Vicks on your upper lip under your nose and you will likely feel an immediate clearing of your stuffy nose. Vicks does dry and lose its vaporizing effect. So you could be wakened again by the same problem. Then, just grab your trusty Vicks and dab it again. As often as you need it all night long.\n",

I was amazed.With my own base coat, after a few days of normal household chores the polish would peel and chip.With Barielle Nail Rebuilding Protein as a base coat, it lasts almost 2 weeks with just a little touch up.My nails look so nice with just Barielle Nail Rebuilding Protein I often don't bother with colored polish.

When I used it on my mirrors they were all smudged. I did not get that usual streak free shine that I usually get with this particular product. I have enjoyed using your Windex/Multisurface, vinegar product in the past and have always passed over the less expensive brands to purchase this particular product because I knew it's quality.

AND don't tell me I'm using it wrong or it's the operator because it is NOT. I've also read the reviews and I'm not the only one complaining about this product. I gave it a very low rating because I KNOW it use to be a good product. Something has changed whether it's the way it's produced or the ingredients. But I will not be purchasing any more of this. I can do better with vinegar and water and it's not has costly and I don't have to waste time trying to get it to not streak or dull up within a day or two..\n",

When I tried windex on a nearby window, it seemed to work fine. I wonder if the previous cleaner had left a residual My husband who has more muscle is going to reclean the glass top bottom.

I still had 80 of the bottle left. So I went and purchased a second 23 oz bottle with the intentions of switching out the tops so that I could use the rest of the first bottle. After one use (cleaned 4 windows and a mirrow) the trigger from the second bottle broke too. Now I am stuck with two almost completely full bottles of windex and no way to clean.

My mirrors were always sparkling clean, but now I have a film and streaks that will not come off. I even went back over them with a clean dry paper towel and there were faint blue smudges on the paper towel. That tells me that Windex is leaving a residue on the glass ... which leads to streaks .... which is frustrating.

I tried changing paper towels and using a clean lint free rag with no improvement. It's been driving me crazy.

I wish you'd bring back the 2-in-1!

The last couple of bottles I purchased have had a much stronger smell to it and it is drying my hair and scalp out really bad. It never used to do this.

The boys were in their suits all day i re-applied several times through out the day, each time I put it on the boys, they were wet. Well at the end of the day, they were also very burned!

We were outside for a couple hours and did not get wet at all. I applied it 20 minutes before we went outside and rubbed it in. My husband only used it on part of his body and those parts were just as burned as the areas he did not use it on. I definitely DO NOT recommend this product!!!\n",

      "I am very fair and burn easily in the sun. I was excited to try this product after reading some reviews. I have tried this lotion several times, thinking I was applying it wrong or something. Everytime I use it, It leaves blotches, especially on my arms and chest no matter how much I tried to rub it in evenly. It also took too long to completely dry. If it is not completely dry, you will have lighter spots where your clothes rub your skin or where your arms bend and such. I just cannot stand still for 30 minutes to an hour for the lotion to dry, not touching anything! The color looked pretty orange. It also had a very bad smell after it was left on for a few hours. Also, it washes right off in the shower so don't even think about taking a bath with this because you will be bathing in orange water. The only thing I do like about the lotion is that it gives you color right away and becomes darker over time, but it'd be better if the color wasn't orange. I absolutely HATE this product and I do not recommend it to anyone, especially fair skinned people.\n",

This time after the first 2-3 days my scalp became dry and itchy. It was so itchy that I just wanted to scrape my scalp right off. Caused sores on my head that were also very itchy. I began to notice my hairbrush filling up with hair. Was cleaning out every week because my hair was falling out. I thought I had just become allergic to the shampoo and conditioner so I gave it to my daughter. Her and her boyfriend began to use it and their scalps became dry and severely itchy. Suave must have changed the formula. They need to pull this product off the shelves and revamp it. Maybe before selling it again the head honchos should taker it home and use it themselves as well as their families. Then they might be more careful about what they are putting on the shelves for the consumer. Please beware if you use this your head will itch like you have never felt an itch before.\n",

The color was different, it felt different, it smelled different, and it wasn't working anymore. I even thought someone was pranking me. So, I decided to search up the old ingredients and compare it to the current conditioner I have. The formula was different. Who ever is responsible for changing the ingredients, PLEASE CHANGE IT BACK! . I really don't want to find a new conditioner because it's so much work.

I finally stumbled on various comments online when I was doing research trying to figure out what was causing my problem that indicated Matrix caused them a similar problem. I immediately changed shampoos and ten days later, my scalp is almost completely clear.

      "I've enjoyed some of Elvis' movies like Viva Las Vegas, Blue Hawaii, and Fun in Acapulco. I received Clambake as a gift to add to my collection, and I thought I'd like it especially because it took place in Miami, where I'm from.Sadly, this was not a very good movie. The late-60s styles were comical, and the young days of Christine from Coach and Bill Bixby from The Hulk were amusing. However, the obvious closed sets, corny acting and oddball music interludes kept me asking why was this movie even produced.The final insult to injury... Elvis and his girl drive into the Florida sunset... with mountains in the background! The only mountains in Miami are trash dumps so this was obviously shot in California and poorly passed off as Miami Beach.So I give it 2 stars: one for Elvis and one for the real Florida.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "There are basically four criteria by which I judge an Elvis movie: the songs and how they relate to the movie's story Elvis' acting performance Elvis' co-stars' performance and the story itself.The songs used in Clambake (especially the title song itself) are not well-written. In fact, they are so forgettable that I can't recall any of them as stand-outs. The best one is probably the one (title) he sings on the beach. The song he co-sings while riding a motorbike in the movie is relatable to the story and it does look like Elvis is into the song. However, I think that speaks more to Elvis' charm as a musical performer. Although if you have ever seen Harum Scarum (and if you have not... I do NOT recommend you do), you will see Elvis at his most UNenthusiastic when it comes to singing the movie's songs. The song he sings to/with the children at the park playground is way too long and seemingly filler material... having little of anything to do with the story.As for Elvis' acting performance, I've seen him give worse performances (Harum Scarum definitely tops the list of other Elvis movies I have seen), but I have also seen better (Loving You, Jailhouse Rock, Viva Las Vegas, to name just three). He definitely held his own in this movie. I'll leave it at that. I don't recall any fight scenes in this movie, which I find/found a refreshing change (it's been a few days since I watched it and have watched other Elvis movies since then).Shelley Fabares (if you remember her from the 80s/90s TV show Coach) was likable as the leading lady in this film. Bill Bixby (later most familiar as David Banner from The Incredible Hulk) played the protagonist well because I didn't like him... which was intentional. Will Hutchins (maybe known from his earlier role in another Elvis movie, Spinout) plays Tom Wilson, the waterski instructor whose identity Elvis' character (Scott Heyward) assumes in the movie... is adequate.As for the story itself, it has (for me) two elements I have enjoyed in my own life (motorcycle riding and waterskiing), so I'm probably being more generous about this movie's appeal then I would be otherwise... but that is why all opinions are biased.Instead of outlining the plot, I will just summarize that visually, this movie is more attractive to the eye than many of Elvis' other movies (that have too many studio sets instead of using outdoor shots). Although most of this film was shot in California than Florida, they pulled it off.Elvis' movies, for the most part were make you feel good movies, so to judge this as anything more than that would be doing Elvis a disservice. This film did mark the beginning of the end for Elvis in a number of ways. It was the last film for which he received a guaranteed million dollar salary. He also began overeating prior to this movie and had to take diet pills to reverse the direction his weight was heading. No more needs to be said.If you are like me and either have only a few Elvis movie DVDs in your collection (I have about 10 of his 31) and are wondering which ones are more enjoyable than others, I can only give you a general guideline and that is that most of his better movies were from the FIRST third of the 31. I don't think you can go wrong at all by picking any of his first five (Love Me Tender, Loving You, Jailhouse Rock, King Creole, and GI Blues) as well as Viva Las Vegas, Blue Hawaii, It Happened At The World's Fair, Roustabout, and Follow That Dream. I think these movies do a better job of showcasing Elvis' untapped acting potential. I wrote untapped because you could see if he was given better scripts (especially after his first five movies), he could have shown so much more of what he had to offer. Thanks a lot Hal Wallis!Overall, I don't recommend this movie for purchase unless you have to have every movie in which Elvis has appeared.\n",

      "Being a low price DVD, you do not really expect much, unfortunately though this really goes too far resulting in the VHS version being far better quality. I expect the powers that be thought this film is only aimed at hardcore Elvis fans and corners were cut, this would be the same thought process that managed to produce these calibre of films to start with. I am also surprised that some of the other films in MGM's vaults were not released first, examples being It Happened At The Worlds Fair and Live A little Love A little, especially with the worldwide success of A Little Less Conversation.\n",

      "Progresso had a Meatball and Rice soup last year (2015) that Target carried in the Bay Area and I loved it, kept going back to purchase larger and larger quantities when I ran out. Then the weather got hot and I stopped buying soup. With winter again, I wanted that soup and couldn't find it anywhere. I was so happy when I found that Target.com had it and purchased more than a dozen cans. Much to my surprise, it's not the same recipe! The soup I had last year was tomato based and only had meatballs. This soup is also tomato based, I think. I couldn't quite tell because of how much oregano was in it. And it had chunks of chicken and bits of corn. It tastes so different from the soup from last year! I've decided to donate the rest of my cans to a food bank for the holidays and hope that someone else will like it more than me. Target.com had great prices and the delivery was incredibly fast. The cans of soup were wrapped in heavy duty plastic bags, somewhat wasteful but definitely helpful to prevent spills should any cans unexpectedly get punctured or damaged, although none were damaged. Too bad the plastic bags had some tiny holes in them, otherwise I could have put them to other uses as pet waste pick-up, oh well. So, overall, the soup was a disappointment but the buying experience was good.\n",

      "My family and I absolutely love the first one. Seen it maybe 8+ times and still cracks me up. That said, after watching the 2nd one, we all thought is was a major let down. The humor was pushed and not natural. Used the grandmother way too much, and each time it wasn't funny, but was ridiculous. And this will be weird saying, but everything was too \"Greek\". Yes, we understand that the family is 100% Greek, but the movie made them out to be absolute idiots (their homes especially). In the last move, Toula ended up being a very strong character, but she is back to being frumpy again at the beginning of the 2nd movie and having to find herself again. The list goes on and on and there are just too many reasons to skip this movie. Go back and watch the first one, laugh and enjoy it, and don't ruin it by witnessing this disappointment.\n",

The product did leave my hair very shiny and smooth....I loved the feel of my hair. Unfortunately I find this product to heavy on my hair as it ended up flat and limp.

I did have a nice shine in my hair and it did smell good, but otherwise it is a no go for me. But everyone has to try it so they came make their own opinion and decide for themselves.

      "My husband and I use Pantene products regularly. This was our first time however, trying Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner. Personally, I was not a fan of this product right from the start. I did not like the scent at all. It has a peculiar medicinal-like smell to it which put me off immediately. Also, I found that these products (both the Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Shampoo Conditioner) were too rich for my fine hair oily scalp. My hair was left lifeless, with no volume and unmanageable. I make an effort not to wash my colour-treated hair everyday to maintain the colour longer. This certainly is not possible with Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner. By the second day after using the shampoo and conditioner, my hair was greasy, flat and smelled bad. Since this product was not right for me, I decided to pass it on to my husband who reports back to me that he likes Pantene Expert Pro-V AgeDefy Conditioner and will likely continue buying it. Although this product is not right for me, it did end up being a success for my husband. This review was collected as part of a promotion.\n",

I don't know why, but that was not the case at all for me. Been using it for a few days now, and I'm ready to stop. My hair feels greasy, it's messy, and not at all behaving like it normally does. I honestly used the last remnants of my regular conditioner bottle watered-down so I could get the last bits out of the bottle (we all do that, right) and that worked better than this.

I was surprised that I felt wetness an hour after I used the new can. I thought it might have been a 'bad' batch that had worked its way to my market. So, I went to a different store and bought another can....same thing happened. Evidently, the formula was changed or something...the last spray from the can from my case worked fine.

In October 2012 the ergonomic handle had to be replaced since it was coming apart which I guess stemmed from the oils in my hand when using the vacuum (design flaw).. The vacuum was under 60 month warranty so Hoover directed me to a local vacuum dealer they recommended here in Florida (second mistake) it was replaced.. While I only vacuum weekly I started to notice a lack of suction power for this vacuum which was disappointing me big time, but not wanting to spend money again I continued on with it.. I clean the wheels, brushes rollers frequently change the bag often whether it needs it or not so not sure what the problem is with this vacuum.. I originally purchased this vacuum to replace my Sears canister vacuum for poor performance, but now I am about to throw in the towel on this one too since its not worth the aggravation would like a vacuum with more suction power to keep my carpets fresh I actually hate to vacuum now because of this issue with this Hoover vacuum.. Hope others that have purchased this vacuum have better luck with it..\n",

      "The upright does (did) a wonderful job until today when I was body slammed by the same peril that did in my last vacuum, plastic parts. Apparently the engineers who constructed this model were in a hurry because they did not adequately assess the forces where the power/control handle meets the shaft. Today mine snapped off at that point without warning. I got this model in Novemeber 2010 because it had top ranking with Consumer Reports. Likewise my prior vac, Kenmore canister, carried a top ranking and plastic fatigue failure in the handle assembly was the culprit there too. Even though I am a guy I am not rough with these units. What I don't understand is the failure to use metal at key stress points so that this does not happen. I'd willingly pay more money for a product that endures.\n",

And advised me to purchase a different vacuum because it would take forever to get the parts. Well, it's January 22nd and still the parts have not come in. Turns out they close for weeks after Christmas and do not reopen until January 11th!

The self adjusting height is nonexistent. When I wrote to Hoover, they just said I must have purchased the wrong vacuum for the carpet. There is no information regarding carpet type in the promotional materials. Don't buy this product.\n",

      "Right out the box...I assembled the vacuum and was excited. I started using the canister and loved it. I would have loved a bag to keep everything together, but I accepted because I loved it. THEN...I used the upright. Still in one room, the sensor light comes on after 5mins of use! Since then the Hoover helpdesk ONLY tells me to send it to a Hoover site for maintenance or Return it to the store. O**ck it is! My sister raved about it and never reported sensor problems.\n",

      "Impossible to push on freize carpet with moderatly high pile. Head does not adjust to accomodate higher pile carpet. Works great with plush low plie. Contacted Hoover and they said tough luck. I have to give it away, and get another vacuum that will work on freize carpet.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "Loved this machine until I replaced my worn out carpet with a low freize. It will not roll over it at all, let Hoover know of the problem and they said it is not designed for high pile carpet or plush padding underneath carpet. They said to return it and by a Hoover with a manual adjusting carpet height button. Well Hoover I've had this for over a year, so I'm out of luck on the return. If I do get a new vacuum it won't be a Hoover because you certainly don't stand behind your product......boasting of an automatic heighth adjuster on this vacuum that really doesn't work.....shame on you for taking my hard earned money!!! I notice that this machine is not for sale anymore in stores...wonder why Please don't buy this machine if you ever plan to put in nice carpet!\n",

      "I bought this vaccum on 5-1-11, it worked fine for 14 months and the handle just snapped in half while I was sweeping one day. It was replaced on 8-1-12 after not being able to be repaired. The same exact thing happened last week again, handle broke! It was only 10 months old!\n",

      "We have owned this vacuum for over a year now. Worked great until we replaced a large room with thick pile, high quality carpet. The auto height adjustment feature does not work properly and continually shuts off the vacuum. In our opinion this is a major flaw and can not recommend this Hoover model.\n",

      "Liked the large bag - hate bagless vacuums because of the mess. But the handle broke just above the bag and it was 200 for the replacement part. That is pretty much the cost of a new one so no value to that. Went with a cheap bagless figured I would just throw it away if a part broke.\n",

      "I had the same experience as GAK2010. The vacuum power light would flash, then the vacuum would turn off. The check bag light never went on, but I discovered the bag was 3/4 full. I changed the bag and also pulled a thread and some dust clogs from the brush. It than ran for about 20 minutes then repeated the problem. I took it to a vacuum repair shop and he cleaned it out thoroughly. 42 later, it continued to shut off. I did not take it t the authorized dealer because he has a terrible reputation, and does not even sell Hoovers. I called Hoover and they suggested I clean the filter under the bag. Didn't solve the problem!\n",
      "-------\n",
      "I thought I was getting a good vacuum based on reviews I read and b/c I had a Hoover previously that lasted 15+ years, but I'm extremely disappointed. I am having to take this vacuum into the repair shop for the second time in 2 years! The first was because the power kept shutting off by itself and now because the entire handle broke off (and I am just doing regular vacuuming on regular carpet). Sure, there is a 5 year warranty, but the service centers are not convenient in any way. Other things I dislike about the vacuum is that it does not adjust to carpet height, and the power button is located in the worst place. Also, the canister is very loud and the hose continually comes out as I'm vacuuming b/c it doesn't have good latch to keep it attached.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "Was very dissappointed. Worked ok on regular carpeting but the sensor that supposedly adjusts from one floor surface to another simply does not work. Looks nice...would have enjoyed the cannister vacuum... but returned it for a less expensive Hoover Windtunnel that works much much better for our needs.\n",

      "I purchased my Hoover Platinum in Nov 2010 to replace another well known vacuum that I had. I specifically selected Hoover because I had Hoover vac's in the past Hoover has a good reliable name. I love the vacuum however, I don't like having to use a separate vac for tools that's bothersome to me. I've just recently replaced the belt brushroller (easy to do) which I felt was about right for 2 yrs of once a week vacuuming. HOWEVER, I was shocked yesterday when I noticed that the inside of the ergonomic handle was peeling away that was very unexpected for a Hoover product in this price point. Sadly this issue with the handle peeling away bothers me since it now means that this vacuum is not really a Platinum but more like Stainless Steel has reached the end of its life span after 2 years.\n",

      "Nice vacuum cleaner, if you DON'T have thick pile carpeting. Beater bar does not automatically adjust as stated. Vacuum shuts down automatically on thick pile, high quality carpet.

      "I the Hoover Platinum Collection and was very happy with it. Then one day the on/off switch started blinking and it has not worked since. The motor will run if you hold it at a 45 degree angle but if you try to run it like a regular sweeper it stops running. For the price it should run better. Unfortunately I do not have my receipt, I have the owners manual, but no receipt. Interestingly enough I had an old Hoover Elite Supreme in the basement and that is what I have been using, it still runs:(\n",

      "I tested four vacuum cleaners. The Dyson DC 41, this vacuum, the shark navigator lift away, and the shark rotator professional. There is not much to say about what I liked about this vacuum. The edge cleaning that it boasts is laughable at best, and the boast about direct air cleaning, also leaves much to be desired, though it did vacuum acceptably. The canister vacuum is virtually useless. It could not even pick up the loose hair from tile floor without me running over it multiple times with that brush attachment. For the price, I definitely expected more, and was sadly disappointed by that name, considering I came from an older Hoover that did its job very well. I settled on the shark rotator pro for it's versatility, price, weight, and vacuuming power.\n",

Checked bag and it was not full and was installed correctly. I plan on returning.\n",

It is awful. They all smell the same. I don't know if people on the west coast are familiar with stink bugs but here on the east coast, there is an infestation. That's exactly how the Clorox wipes smell now. Please change back to the old formula QUICK!!!!!!\n",

      "I use Clorox wipes fanatically all over my home and I have done so for years - I have always loved them...until now! I just got the wipes with grease fighting power and it smells HORRIBLE. The main reason I use these wipes is because they make stuff smell fresh and clean. I am sad to say, I may be looking for a new product. Maybe Clorox can offer 2 different kinds I don't really have grease in my bathroom, or on my main kitchen counter spaces, usually grease is only on my stove...\n",

      "LOVE Clorox wipes, but this batch is horrible. The wipes have separated and won't come out of canister in one piece. They rip and tear apart which then makes using 1 wipe useless. You have to get several out just to clean something. The smell is great tho.\n",

It may cut grease now but I liked the old streak free formula a lot better and it smelled nice. Whatever is in the new formula that cuts grease also makes my hands burn. I've switched to my store brand now since they work just as well as the new formula and they smell better. And they don't make my hands burn when I use them! And they don't leave streaks all over my bathroom counters, mirrors and stove like the Clorox wipes do now. Everyone (including me) used to love Clorox wipes when they first came out. Learn a lesson Clorox- if it isn't broke, don't try to fix it!\n",

While the new wipe is textured on one side and soft on the other I felt like I had to scrub much harder and the surface didn't get as clean. I will not buy this product again.\n",

Yes, this product did disinfect, but the smell was way, way too pungent for me. I used it to wash down the bathroom floors, the outside of the commode. Days later, the smell still lingered (which would have been nice if it smelled nice). My scrub bucket, sponge, gloves were kept in my cleaning closet and I had to end up throwing the gloves and sponge out. Within minutes it just reaked up the whole closet. Trust me, stick with the all purpose cleaner now known as clean and fresh. It does disinfect and smells nice, which to me is important. No brainer.

I applied the lip shimmer and realized that it was totally rancid. I looked at the ingredients and see that they've changed the formulation to include soy oil and canola oil....both of these oils go rancid VERY quickly and actually promote free radical damage because they are unstable oils.

It is (was) a great color with bronze/brown tones that worked well for my tones. I got compliments all the time. Apparently Burt's Bees has elected to revamp these colors for no apparent reason, and all of these new colors are very pink toned. You will notice that all of the many, many complaints are from people who preferred bronze or brown tones who have been left behind by this change. I am at a loss to explain why this company would ignore such brand loyalty by changing these colors for essentially no reason, and while providing no acceptable substitute. Please reconsider this decision to provide only pink-toned Lip Shimmers, and bring back the bronze-toned ones, especially wonderful Papaya!\n",

Tried it in the store and it rolled up a little and it rolled down. I left the store, got in my car, while driving, I went to apply...rolled it up, applied, then it would not roll down.

      "I bought this product thinking I would love it because I love the clear regular burts bees, but this berry color easily comes off when you drink anything and if you accidentally get it on your skin around your lips good luck getting it off...it just makes your skin look irritated and red.

      "My lips tend to get dry easily and this product didn't effectively hydrate them. In fact, it highlighted the dry ridges on my lips in quite an unflattering way. It was fine appearance-wise if I had just exfoliated my lips, but dreadful otherwise. I ended up having to buy a different product. It's probably good for those with normal lips.\n",

      "This was a great product, but now the colors my friends and I have used in the past are no longer available.We wasted a lot of time walking the aisles of many, many stores searching for our colors. Why do you do this We have tried several of your other colors and do not like them. I'm giving two stars because of your color choices. Please return to the colors such as Nutmeg and Toffee. My friends and I are currently using other products, but would return to Burt's Bees Lip Shimmer if you added the old colors back to your collection.\n",

      "I used to be a big fan of Burts Bees, but have recently scrutinized the ingredients of every product I use.I am an avid make up fan with a medical and scientific research background. The ingredient carmine is actually acquired from killing a certain type of beetle. It is a pinkish/red dye which comes from this bug and we put it all over our face. Some people don't really care but I think it's a little icky. Carmine is also has other names, can't recall exactly, like Red 4 and some others. This information is easy to find. I think it's interesting that all of the fruit oils are given their pleasant names however carmine does not say beetle dye in parentheses next to the ingredient name. When I wore this lip shimmer prior to gaining this knowledge, I did enjoy the colors and the conditioning properties. Burt's Bees is a good company, but not as perfect as everyone believes. Better than many others. I have stopped using this product and the many others containing carmine from all brands, including Dior, MAC, Benefit, and countless others.Though it appears that the color radiance is lacking the beetle dye.\n",

      "when I was a kid, I used to make lip color by grinding up blush and mixing it with lip balm. burt's lip shimmer reminds me of that. there is too much pigment and it sits on top of the lips. not very sheer. so the first application looks ok but if you want to re-apply it builds up and looks thick and uneven. merlot would have been the perfect color, but it was too pigment heavy -- you have to look in the mirror when you apply it. if they eased up on the pigment a little, it would be great. I prefer balms that look like a transparent berry stain, and this is not it. it's more like a dark lipstick. unfortunately, their ligher colors are no better. they're lighter, but they're still not sheer.\n",

      "I received this for free in exchange for an honest review. Initially this scent booster smells great and quite strong. I used more than recommended because I have a house full of active boys. Unfortunately, the smell did not last long and was not very strong after the wash. Also, the smell is quite pleasant from the bottle, but there is a lingering odor in my laundry room that is not so great. The lingering smell is a bit too `natural` for my liking; Somewhat like an outdoor odor, which is what I am trying to get rid of.\n",

      "The juicer seemed ok and was quiet. After a few days I noticed it was leaking juice that should have be going into the juice reservoir was instead going into the waste basket. The pulp was WET and I noticed I was wasting money having to use more fruits/veg to get some juice out.. I returned and got a new breville which spits out almost dry pulp much better than this cuisinart.\n",

For example, it took 2.5 lbs of kiwi and 2 large apples to product a container of juice. The product is very well made but perhaps juicing isn't in our budget. I am returning this product.\n",

      "I have been a faithful and ecstatic fan of Iman for her line of makeup and curtains, however this product was a great disappointment. : ( It was disappointing because it is so easy to carry around its virtually invisible, its the size of a lipstick and its at a great economical price but its so hard to apply, its hard to smooth on evenly over your face and it does not come with an applicator. I guess this product was named Iman clay makeup because it literally feels like you are smoothing clay onto your face and that isn't something I was looking forward to.\n",

      "I was excited to try this foundation considering the good reviews and Iman has several different shades to choose from for women of color. I really wanted to like this product but I didnt for many reasons. First of all I bought this one shade too light in Clay 5 and I found out that my shade is an Earth 1. Secondly, it broke me out. I do not think this kind of foundation is meant for somebody with Oily skin such as myself, but I tried Iman's semi loose powder for my other foundations and I have to say that I love it! the powder is great for oil control and it goes on smooth. If you are somebody with normal/Dry skin, then I would recommend this product for you.\n",

This is NOT it. When it arrived in the mail, the front label says RED RICE on the back it says it's brown rice.So, yes, I should have read the whole description closer, but just calling brown rice red on the label doesn't make it so.Disappointed, will not be buying any more Lundberg products.

I could not stand it. After a few minutes of having it on, I had to go wash it off. It started to give me a headache! And I promise, I am not exaggerating. -- With that being said.. If you can tolerate such strong scent on your face all day or don't mind it then this is for you. It does set the foundation and can qualify as a dupe for high end setting powders. As to how well it works or how long it helps.. IDK. Since I couldn't stand wearing it for more than a few minutes. I really wish it didn't have such a strong scent. I would have liked to keep it!\n",

Plus the applicator absorbs most of the product, making you go through the color faster. Once I got past the bad packaging and applicator, I was not at all happy with the weird consistency. It was not glossy, kinda like a stain (not long lasting), not as bold of a color I was looking for. Oh well, I will continue on hunting for that perfect gloss.\n",

      "1) This product was missing pieces. Not screws or nails. But actual wood pieces. Thankfully I took an inventory before assembling it and called them for replacements.2) Once I had all the pieces and began to assemble it...it was almost impossible. (I am an architect and carpenter.) Unlike other flat-packed furniture these aren't finished on all sides and the instructions don't make it clear which side the veneer faces a number of times which leads to assembling and the taking it apart and re-assembling it. That alone was infuriating enough...but even on the first attempt the screws are such low quality that the screw heads were stripped out so I had to use an extraction bit and then go buy new screws from a hardware store.3) Once I, thankfully, was done assembling it I put it in place and put my bedside lamps on it and they scratched the veneer off immediately. And the lamps have rubber feet. So you should plan on calling a glass shop to make a stand-off (just rubber bumpers) like I did to make these last more that a week.4) Lastly, just to know. This furniture isn't veneered on all sides like most furniture. Even inside the drawers. So unless you paint the inside of the drawers you will be looking at particle board when you open them which isn't a particularly elegant look.Bottom line: It looks like the picture from the outside but that's it...and only it.

Went in to pick it up and asked the clerk to take it out of the box to inspect it. Weld wasn't a problem this time but instead there was black paint \"globbed\" all over the bottom of the screen. It wouldn't brush off so I told them to return it.Very disappointed -- loved the design -- it would have been perfect.

I decided to test the Lysol product and Clorox Disinfecting Bathroom Cleaner, which is also approved by Kohler. Plus, the label says it is safe to use on plastics. The Lysol product did a good job - the tested locations on tub and countertop were shiny when rinsed and dried. However the Clorox product left the test spots on the tub and counter dull, and I was really afraid it had done damage to the finish.

      "I love salt and vinegar chips, but these Lay's Salt and Vinegar chips are patheticWhat I love about them:Inexpensive - compared to other brands of potato chips, these are cheap and are often on saleEasy to find in stores - compared to other brands of potato chips, these are extremely easy to find in stores, and available just about everywhereSalty - these chips are very salty and you taste the salt in every biteWhat I don't like about them:Too much vinegar - these chips have way too much vinegar and have an unpleasing bitter taste to themSoggy/wet feeling and consistency - these chips have a very soggy and wet consistency to them. They feel filmy, like vinegar film, not like salt film, and have a very soggy overall taste that lessens the crunch. They don't feel wet, but the consistency is wet, very unappetizingNot very crunchy - unlike other brands of salt and vinegar chips, these are not very crispy. They are very thin, slightly thicker than paper, and don't really have much of a crispness to speak ofAlways broken chips - every time I've ever purchased this brand of salt and vinegar chips, whether online or in a store, the chips are almost always broken all throughout the bag. The bag is very thin, compared to other brands, and the chips are always brokenAt the end of the day, these are terrible salt and vinegar chips and there are so many tastier and crispier varieties out there, that I no longer consider this brand\n",

      "I installed this the first of the year in 2014. Medium sized is a bit of a stretch. Wish I would have brought bigger because the wood splits must be small to fit in this stove. The spring handles supplied (2) never were able to stay on. The blower unit which came with this stove began making a loud rattling sound after only three weeks of operation. After the stove gets hot and fired up, it does put out a decent amount of heat for its size.\n",

      "1800 sq. Ft., not on your best day. Heats 600 sq. Ft. Good. You may have some hot coals after 6 hrs. But the burn time is more like 3 hrs. Logs must be split very small. I thought maybe the bad reviews were because it wasn't being dampered properly, not the case. The good reviews must be employees. Tried it on a 30 degree night in October, not looking forward to January and February. I guess you get what you pay for, lesson learned!\n",
      "-------\n",
      "This stove is far from medium size. The fire box cant fit 2 4\" diameter logs side by side and if there is anymore than 2 inches of coals good luck putting wood in it without having flaming chunks fall out. Don't count on overnight fire unless you jam as much wood as you possibly can in every Crack and crevis around the wood at 11 at night only then you may still feel some heat at 3:30 am. You need to clean the ash/coals every day or 2 otherwise the build up to muchOn a positive note the stove is easy to light and easy to control the fire. It does throw some serious heat wide open but eats wood rather quickly that way and you will only get 2 hrs per load.\n",

So I'm stuck with a woodstove that is already installed and wish I would have purchased somewhere else.\n",

      "To be honest, I grew up with an amazing old cast iron wood burning stove and have been pretty spoiled by its longevity and quality. I am now building my own home and needed a medium size stove for my small space. I had done my research and this Pleasant Hearth stove seemed like a good fit. I took careful note of the measurements because my husband and I wanted a firebox big enough for medium to large pieces of wood. We have NOT tested the stove yet as it is still summer, however, just on first inspection, it had some issues...When we went to pick up the stove, a forklift brought it over to our car on what turned out to be a broken (crushed to pieces!) pallet so that when we drove it over an hour to our house, it leaned frighteningly in the back. We would have asked for a different pallet but the stove itself was screwed to what was left of one of the slats. Fortunately, none of the legs were bent.When we got the stove home and unwrapped it, I was SHOCKED at how small the actual firebox opening is! PLEASE NOTE: the picture online and on the box of the stove is seriously misleading: the picture shows a huge glowing fire behind a lovely glass door. In reality, the glass door is way bigger than where you actually stick the wood in so when you are looking at your nice glowing fire, you only really see a small narrow section of it.Another issue that has yet to be seriously tested is the spot welding all over the stove. The big stove I grew up with is welded all around very securely. This Pleasant Hearth stove has all of these weird little spots of welding here and there that I 'm concerned may not stand the test of time.My last major issue with this stove is the coiled wire handles that come with it. There are two of them and the instructions say they should \"screw on\" easily. NOT the case! My husband spent two hours cranking on them and tooling them to fit.Like I said, we have not used the stove yet. It has not gotten us through a winter yet. I am hoping that it will. Overall, for $800, I wish that it had been closer to perfect.\n",

      "came with a couple of cracked bricks but they sent new ones out within 3 days. I went through the break in heating and all was well until my first full fire. the paint started flaking off all over the top of it. it was reading 370 degrees with a digital thermometer. exhaust pipe was 310 so even with the vent fully closed as they say to do after it is fully heated.. most of the heat was escaping. not as efficient as they advertise.. it burns on low for a good 5 hrs at the most with a full load of dry seasoned wood. the glass gets dirty quick. its a decent built stove, but it already looks 10 yrs old within the first 3 weeks of operating it. needs to be cleaned a lot and kind of hard to do because you have to lift the brick out of the middle to put the ashes in the pan. decent stove, good heat, but a lot goes out the chimney. the blower is kind of noisy and really doesn't put out much air anyway...it would be great for a cabin or workshop. but as a center piece in your home, I would spend more money on a better quality one. ive had the catylic type before and it was a pain as well. my suggestion is when buying a stove, spend the money. you will only have to do it once and it will pay for itself. decent stove, if it were 200 cheaper I would say buy one of you don't mind a old looking black iron stove. it heats up my 1500 sq ft home. but I have to get up in the middle of the night to add wood and stoke it again. it will not burn for 8 to 10 hrs as advertised.. 5 at the most. you will have coals that are hot after 7 hrs. but that's it. and that is fully closed damper on the lowest setting. it goes about an hr or so on full on heat. kinda like a steam engine. you need to keep shoveling wood in it if you want full heat on a freezing day!!\n",

It does not hold as well and the new fragrance is overpowering. bring back the old formula! A piece of advise from one business person to another: When you have a very good product that people like, DON'T change it. Don't try to fix something that isn't broken. Thank you for forcing me to search for a replacement brand!\n",

      "My husband has been using this gel for at least 15 years. A few weeks ago when I went to buy him a few new bottles (I always buy at least 3 at a time) I could no longer find it. I finally bought him the new gold bottle and hoped it would work. Well, after 3 weeks using it he said there was no way he could continue with it. He gave it a fair try but said he hates everything about it. The consistency, the smell, and most importantly it doesn't hold. Guess, we will start at square one and began testing gels.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "I've been using Nexxus Exxtra Gel for 30 years and loved the old formula because it provided great hold for my straight hair and was fragrance-free (at least to my sense of smell.) The new formula provides no hold and the scent gives me terrible headaches. Please bring back the old formula! Thank you.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "I am so disappointed with the new gel. Why did you change the old gel I was a loyal customer for ten years at least. I recommended this product to so many people. I have thick, curly and frizzy hair, and this stuff was the BEST product. Also there was no strong scent. Now I am at a total loss. I cannot imagine that anyone is happy with the change and the scent is horrible. If people want a strong scent they should wear perfume, not get the smell in their hair gel. Why did you change it\n",
      "-------\n",
      "I loved the old formula and used it every day. Tried to use the new one and tossed it after a couple of times. It's so bad for my hair type that I couldn't even finish the tube! I won't buy anymore Nexxus products unless the old formula or something similar comes back.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "This new formula of gel is terrible! The smell is too strong, and it dries my hair out! The old formula was fantastic! Bring it back! I have long naturally curly hair, and the old gel worked perfectly to keep away the frizz. It made my curls defined and my hair looked wonderful! It's hard finding just the right product, and the new gel isn't it. Please bring back the previous formula!!!!\n",
      "-------\n",
      "I have been using this gel for a long time and finally found a gel that works great with my curly hair. You recently changed the formula and the scent and it is not the same. I have more fly aways in my hair than ever before.Now I have to find a new gel.The name of the gel is the same but NOT the product....Please Please bring back the old version. Why change something that works just fine\n",
      "-------\n",
      "I loved the Nexxus Exxtra Gel Superior Hold Sculpting gel in the light bronze tube. I guess it's discontinued because I can't find it any more. Bought the peach colored tube that sounded like the same product, but the fragrance is horrible (Blue Waltz cologne) and the product left my hair sticky. Now I've got to find another product because this one will be leaving with the trash tomorrow.\n",

      "I just bought the new formula, new packaged, Extra Gel. It HAS TOO MUCH PERFUME! There is a cloud of perfume odor around my head, all day. Ugh. I have been using this product for 25 years because is holds curls great, and did not have a strong perfume. Why did you change it Please take the perfume out! Don't buy this new version unless you want people to smell you before you arrive.\n",

      "The old formula held your hair much better and it didn't have such an overpowering scent. My hair is thick and coarse and the old formula was the only thing that worked to keep my hair in place. The new formula doesn't work for me and my Dr. says He can't handle the smell. I'm not to happy about it either. Bring back the old formula with a different name. Maybe exxtra gel 2\n",
      "-------\n",
      "I have been using the Nexxus EXXtra Gel since the late 80's. So I am used to new packaging and looks. However, this time you have absolutely destroyed a great product. The hold isn't as good, and the smell. Yes I said smell, not fragrance. It smelled like I had a salon following me around all day. I couldn't wait to get home from work and get it out of my hair. Thanks for nothing!!\n",
      "-------\n",
      "Change for the better is always appreciated..........in this case,....it failed miserably!!! The new formula along with its new scent misses the mark completely. You have changed the product so dramatically that it's not anywhere near the same caliber of product that it replaces. Please have this new product re-evaluated and return it to its original formula without the new scent.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "I have used this gel for many years and was super sad to see the new formula. I have given it a chance and used it for 2 weeks trying to see if I could use more, add mousse, dry it less, or anything to get the same results as I did with the old formula. All to no avail. My hair is frizzy by lunch time, it doesn't hold a good shape, and it just doesn't do the job . I can even overlook the smell if it held decently. Please bring the old stuff back! Until then, I am on the hunt for a new gel.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "Please bring back the old gel formula!!! This new gel is terrible, makes the hair dry like straw with no holding power and no SHINE to the hair!! Why in the world would you have changed such a good product. The scent is over powering as well!! Please bring the old gel back, it was the only gel ever that worked for me and by the sounds of it many others. Now I have to go find another gel and it will be very hard to compare with it. Please reconsider and bring back the old gel!!!\n",
      "-------\n",
      "As other customers have indicated, the new formula is of far inferior quality compared to the previous version. I read on this page that there will be an adjustment to return to a tweaked version of the older formula. Can you provide a time frame for this I have been a loyal customer for a decade, and I really abhor the idea of having to test other brands to find a replacement.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "I loved the old product, so much so that I paid the overpriced cost. It was perfect. This new product New York Salon Care is nowhere near as effective at keeping my very fine hair full of body. I am very frustrated that I bought the new product expecting it to be of the same quality. The fragrance has even changed for the worse. Please, bring back the old product or tell me where I can purchase your old inventory. Thank you for letting me provide my feedback.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "The new formula is a weaker, runnier gel. But the bigger problem is the scent! It's way too perfumed. After only 10 minutes it's giving me a headache. I'll be switching to ANYTHING else starting tomorrow. I've been using Nexxus gel for about 14 years. Between it's previous strength and previous non-offending scent it is unacceptable to not offer the original product any longer.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "Nexxus should not have changed their packaging or their ingredients. I am really bummed about it. I have been using this product for a really long time and for them to change it doesn't make sense. So Many people loved this product but are now finding something else to use instead. I hope they go back to the original product.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "I've used Nexxus Extra Gel since 1984. The recent change in the product is more than disappointing. It is not as thick as the longstanding version, is heavily scented, does not last as long or wash out as easily. The previous version is the best I have ever used, it is a shame they felt they needed to tinker with it. So long to a loyal 30+ year customer!\n",
      "-------\n",
      "Why in the world would a company change the formula of a perfect styling product that has worked for me for 15+ years to a scent that smells like baby oil/powder It just completely floors me that Nexxus would think adults want to smell like that Thank goodness I was able to return it to the store I purchased it from. I wouldn't even give it away to someone.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "Please please please bring back the old formula styling gel!! I've used your gel for over 20 yrs, absolutely loved it!! This new formula is terrible, weighs down my hair and makes it feel straw like. No other product could ever compete with the old formula. You love making hair beautiful, you will not do it with this new gel. Please reconsider, bring it back!!!\n",

      "I'm biracial (black and white) and every biracial person's hair is slightly different from the next biracial person's. Unlike a lot of black and and white biracial people I know, I can't use products like Carol's Daughter and Mixed Chicks. For years, literally years, I searched high and low and low for a product that would tame my mane. I finally found the Exxte Gel and it was like the hair gods smiled on me. Perfect is an understatement. It kept my normally super frizzy, over-the-top-puffy hair tame, smooth, shinny, and appropriately volumized. Additionally, I could get two or three days worth of style put of one application which was AMAZING because before the Exxtra Gel, I'd spend a crazy amount of time wrestling my hair into a tight bun. BUT that was before the formula change. WHAT HAPPENED. Now the gel feels more alcohol or water based. I have to use three times as much. It flakes. I have to rinse it out everyday. It smells weird. It leaves weird dry, frizzy patches. In no way are blow dryers welcome with this new formula. I don't know why Nexxus ruined a wonderful thing that didn't need to be fixed. PLEASE BRING BACK THE LAST FORMULA. P.S. The new branding is beautiful. The sort of rose gold color is really nice....but the formula has to be reverted.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "I've used Nexxus Exxtra Gel for many years and until the recent change to this product would have given it an excellent rating..........but not now!!! I've always kept an ample supply of Exxtra Gel (for personal use) but once in the past several years I ran out and was unable to purchase any for a couple of weeks. I purchased a product of lesser quality for a lesser price just to get by. Well, the NEW Nexxus Exxtra Gel is the same product as the cheaper, thinner, WAY less superior product that I purchased as a get by replacement. I won't mention the name or the maker of the product.......but it's like you filled an Exxtra Gel tube with their gel. I am VERY disappointed. I will be shopping for a better product.\n",

      "I have been using the old formula for years with my thick natural curly hair. I loved how it kept frizz under control in the worst HOT humid weather. It held the curl so nicely without the sticky, heavy feel. It was the best stuff on the market! I have no idea why Nexxus would change the product. Why not just create a new line If you don't have curly hair, you have no idea how difficult it is to find a winner of a product to keep hair natural and at it's best. I am soooo unhappy with the hold and the smell in the new formula. Please, please, please bring back the old formula. I am desperately buying up all old product I can find and don't know what I will do when my supply is gone.\n",

      "Nexxus XXtra Gel formula was changed with NO NOTICE to the consumer (label is exactly the same although the tube color is different). The change is terrible! The product comes out of the tube as a soft Jello instead of a styling gel as before. It won't stick to your fingers for applying, and after styling and drying exactly as done with the old formula, my hair is limp instead of firmly styled. The next time I tried using more product and my hair became a sticky, gluey mess that I had to immediately wash off! This product should have been labeled NEW FORMULA to warn customers - or better yet, IT SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN CHANGED IN THE FIRST PLACE!!\n",
      "-------\n",
      "I have used the original Nexxus Exxtra Gel product for years. I absolutely loved it, it was the best hair gel on the market by far. I have curly hair and have tried everything out there, but there was no comparison. I can not understand why Nexxus would change their Gel formula. It is now by far the worst hair gel I have every used, so now it's back to finding something new. I beg Nexxus to bring their original formula back! I can't imaging why they wouldn't seeing that mostly all those that reviewed it feel the same. Also I don't think I have ever written a review about anything but because I was so disappointed I felt I had to! :(\n",

      "Received a free sample of the newer formula. The smell is not as bad as the previous new formula. The hold is still not up to par the with the old formula that we are all used to. The newer formula also flakes. Please bring back the old formula. Why would you mess with something that everyone has loved for the past 20+ years\n",
      "-------\n",

      "I have naturally curly hair. The old formula was the right mix for my curls. It tamed the frizz, wasn't too heavy and smelled good. The new formula reeks, and I may as well use motor oil on it. It looks worse after I put it on. Please bring back the old one. I have dozens of bottles of gels I have tried in my cabinet that just doesn't compare.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "I used the old formula for more than 10 years and it was perfect. I have very long (below my waist) natural curly hair and live in humid Florida. I have tried many products but nothing ever came close to the original formula of Nexxus Exxtra Gel. The original formula had the right amount of hold, didn't dry my hair, it actually felt moisturized, no flakes, no crunch and it controlled frizz. I loved it! It's all I needed, no spray, mousse, leave-in... nothing else! I recommended it to anyone that ask what I used. Why change it! The new formula is as horrible as it smells, if not worse. My hair feels horrible and it doesn't control frizz at all. Now I find myself searching for a new product all over again. Please bring back the previous formula!\n",
      "-------\n",
      "I have been using your product for many years, I have very thick course hair, the old formula was the only product that would hold my hair in place (all day). It also allowed me to have the wet or dry look and the smell of the gel was great! I tried the new formula and I could not wait to get home from my night out the wash the gel out of my hair, the smell was AWFUL! Please listen to your core customers and bring back the old formula! Please!!!\n",
      "-------\n",
      "I agree with all the other reviewers. We all probably started using the Exxtra Gel because the others didn't hold as well. The new formula is like the other gels that just don't hold. To make it even worse, they added a fragrance that smells like you are constantly breathing in hairspray. If I try to use more gel to get more hold, it is difficult to breathe because of the fragrance. I'm not exagerating. Please bring back an Exxtra Classic version.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "I am in total agreement. I have been using this product for over 20 years. The new formula is watery, has no hold and is too fragrant. I can live with the fragrance but I cannot live with the lack of performance. I do hope they reconsider and go back to the old formula or at least a mix of the 2. As far as im concerned, this product is useless for my hair type. Hoping to find a replacement. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated :)\n",
      "-------\n",
      "I loved the old Exxtra Gel. I used it for years and have always feared that I wouldn't be able to find it. It held my hair in place exactly as I desired all day. This new formula has an overwhelming smell. And it holds your hair for about 15 minutes. I may as well put water through my hair. I have read review after review on this new formula which agree with me. Please go back to the original formula. Nexxus has lost my business.\n",

      "My husband and sons have used the old gel for the last 10 years and it is the only product that has worked for their style and hair texture. They are extremely particular about their hair and it has worked for all 3 of them - in addition to the many I have spent over the years on it. The new formula smells AWFUL my hubby is constantly complaining his head now itches ..... PLEASE bring back the old formula - NEXXUS - I do not think you did well on your market research - men use this product and do not want to smell like a rose ... If you do not plan - can you let us know where to buy the original non scented formula.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "I have used Exxtra Gel for about 20 years. I don't know why you changed a product that was superior from every other gel on the market. The new scent is irritating to my eyes and the hold is not as strong. I have very thick and curly hair and nothing was better than the old Exxtra Gel. I used to get compliments on my curls all the time and friends would always ask me what gel I was using because my hair looked so amazing. This gel is not doing the job and I'm looking for alternatives. It looks like I am not the only one that is upset here. Please reconsider bringing back the Exxtra Gel that we all love! Please!\n",

      "I have also used only Nexxus products for the last 20 years for all my hair care needs (I.e. Therappe, Diametress, Humectress etc.) including Exxtra Gel but sadly I am extremely disappointed with the new formula. I am OK with the smell but nothing more. It does NOT hold my curly hair at all, as a matter of fact it feels like watery alcohol. I am dreading going on a hunt to find a new gel that will hold my hair like your old formula but sadly will have to. I think it would be a good idea to take into account just how many long time users are complaint about your new formula. :(\n",
      "-------\n",
      "Instead of asking me to contact customer service (unless you have a secret back stock of the old formula) please explain why you changed a product that worked well. I can only assume it's cheaper to produce this watery mess. This stuff doesn't hold anything. The search begins unless you can tell us when you plan to bring back the old. Even Coke admitted their error and they seem to be doing ok. It's obvious to all (and hopefully you by now) that this stuff is junk so the sooner you cut your losses, the less time loyal customers will have to find a permanent replacement.\n",

No other product has ever even come close to it. WHY, OH WHY would you go and change it! It's AWFUL now! It smells horrible, it's so thin and watery feeling on my hair and my hair is a frizzy mess once it dries with this gel in in. The old gel formula used to keep my curls beautiful, together and soft for at least two days! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, I'm begging you to bring back the old formula!\n",

I have resorted to buying out old stock thru ebay as this was a big part of my daily regimen sadly its gone now...The new Professional version is not the same the scent is overpowering like an old ladies perfume. -PLEASE BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL\n",

      "I have always been a huge fan and advocate for Nessux gel and have been using it for more than 10 years. The New Formula has been a huge disappointment! I like the fact that it was a bit thicker and the scent is great, but the performance is far from the standard that the original Nexxus gel had set many years ago. The New Formula doesn't hold like it used to. After 2 hours my hair started losing its shape and style. The worst part of the New Formula is it flakes! I always love Nexxus gel for its ability to keep its shape through out the day and flake free! I remember days when I used to slept with Nexxus gel in my hair and woke up the next day, impress with how it still retain the shape of my hair without any flakes. I am writing this review to show how disappointed I am with the New Formula. I don't see myself ever using this product again at this rate.\n",

      "When Nexxus reformulated the new formula I had hopes that they had heard their customers. Unfortunately they fell short again with their reformulated new product.

Did you test this product before changing it\n",

Creating a product with fragrance seemed to be a priority over creating a product that delivers results.\n",

      "I have been using Nexxus Exxtra Gel for YEARS and it was wonderful for my thick naturally curly hair. There was NO other product out there that worked as good as that one DID. I have tried just about every single brand and type of hair gel over the years and the old formula was the BEST. And since this change... I have yet to find any product that works to control my hair like the old product did. Why did you do this!! BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL FORMULA!!!!!\n",

      "Just discovered that the gel I have used successfully for years is no longer available and the replacement contains a preservative - polyquaternium, to which I am allergic. This happened with a previous product I used. The formula was changed and I wondered why my face was turning red and itchy. After visits to the dermatologist I discovered quaternium was the culprit. There are surprising few hair products without this substance. Very disappointed that Nexxus has discontinued a perfectly good product - why\n",

      "I have been using Exxtra gel for more than 20 years and have been extremely happy with it. However this new formula has very little hold and I hate the strong smell. Why would you change a great thing Please bring back the old formula that deserves the name Exxtra.\n",

      "Used the original product for many years. I've tried the new version for several months and am giving up to look for an alternative. Really wish the old version could be revived or at least an explanation offered for the change. This no longer qualifies as an Extra Hold product in my book.\n",

      "Never gave much thought about what I used to keep my hair in place over the years, I just used what my wife had around the house, as long as it wasn't greasy or smelly. So now on my own, as a widow, I used up what was always around over several years. I don't use much. Finally I had to replace the Nexxus Styling Gel, Pure Control Stylizer. I tried the revised Nexxus replacement product and had to throw it out. It was too greasy feeling and the smell was just to much. I hope you do bring back the prior formula, I haven't found a replacement, and one never knows what is missed until it isn't around anymore. And yes for me, this is a good problem to have most of my hair to deal with in my 70's. thx\n",

      "I have loved the Exxtra gel for about a decade, and I could sense that a change was coming with this gel quite some time ago. I thought it was being totally discontinued, so I rounded up every bottle I could find in the tan packaging and stock piled them. I was relieved to see Nexxus had released Exxtra gel in a shiny new package, and I promptly bought a few bottles online. My happiness changed forever when I realized that more than just the packaging had changed. Where had my beloved Exxtra gel gone The new formula does nothing for my frizz and curls, and to make matters worse the new scent is so overpowering! Nexxus should have specified on the packaging new formula when this was re-released...It is not the same gel, yet it boasts the same name. I will never buy this product again. I am now saving the rest of my tan Exxtra gel bottles for special occasions, and I'm now on the search for a new gel product all together. Such a shame.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "If you bring back the old formula, I can GUARANTEE/PROMISE you, Nexxus, that I will buy YOUR hair gel, and NOBODY else's. The old formula was the BEST on the market ...period. As long as you sell it, I will buy it. I will not buy this new formula again, once was enough. Please bring the old formula back.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "I have used Nexxus for years, I have fine hair, it was the best gel I had ever used. But no more, it is thin and smells like dish soap. The new tube does not make it any better. I wish I had known they were going to change it. I would have bought a boat load of the old gel.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "I have used Nexxus EXXTRA Gel for years, but it is time to find a new gel if you don't bring back the original formula. I don't like the smell of the new formula and it doesn't hold as well as the old formula. Not to mention, the old formula was the only gel I have been able to find that I was able to get it wet and style my hair again later in the day. I won't buy another Nexxus product if this new formula is all you are going to sell going forward. And I only gave 1 star because you have to select at least one.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "I totally agree with the hundreds of others who are extremely dissatisfied with the new formula and smell of what used to be the best hair gel on the market. I have been using this gel for 30+ years so why change it now! Nothing works like this one did. Please go back to the old formula!!! And please get rid of the horrid smell!\n",

      "2 out of 5 stars. Donald 2 months ago YOU CHANGED THE FORMULA.....NOT GOOD! Dear Nexxus: I have used your Exxtra Gel, Superior Hold for several years, sold in the tan colored tube. Within the last 6 months or so, the packaging has changed to the copper colored tube, and the gel is different as well. It is less thick and does not hold as well. I was in a store recently and managed to find the older version. It reaffirms my contention that this new formula is not as effective as the old one. Please bring it back!!! Yes, I recommend this product. Review photo 1 Photo This action will open a modal dialog.

      "I have used the old formula since 2003 and I was super happy with it. The new one is so bad and doesn't hold my hair. I had to start searching for different brands. If you don't want to loose all your consumers , bring the old gel back !!!!\n",

      "The new Exxtra Gel formula is awful. The old formula was by far the best offered in the market in terms of providing an extra long-lasting hold along with a wet look when desired. The new formula provides zero utility and smells offensive to boot with an undeniably far more powerful fragrance. PLEASE bring the old formula back. I saw Nexus responding in posts last month that an improved/restored formulation will be offered shortly. I really hope this comes to fruition. Although no competitor products I have recently tried come close to measuring up to the original formula, several are indeed superior to your new offering and will unfortunately become my go-to once my current supply of old Exxtra Gel is gone.\n",

      "I have been using your sculpting gel for quite a few years now and found it really made a difference for my straight hair to hold a style. This new formulation in the pinkish bronze tube does nothing at all, has no hold to it. I do not recommend it for any hair type. So why did you change your formula, Nexxus\n",
      "-------\n",
      "Was disappointed when tried to purchase the usual Exxtra gel and saw they were out. I finally found it but noticed the packaging was different. Much to my surprise I found that they had changed the formula. I gave it a try and immediately notice that this was definitely not the same, nor was as good. First was the fragrance, the old had little to no smell to it, but this new one had too strong a smell. I don't want my hair product to have a scent, that is what cologne is for. My wife immediately commented to me that the scent bothered her. The next issue is that the feel, hold and and styling was not as good as before. It make my hair my hair feel soft after, but so did the original. Bottom line is I don't think this is as good a product as the original. Please bring the original formula back and soon. I loved the old product much better!\n",

      "I can no longer find the original Exxtra Gel - Superior Hold gel that I've been using for years, so I did try your new formula. I do not like it. I returned it. I find that the new formula does not hold as well as the original, and the new scent is way too strong! From your responses to the other disappointed reviews, I'm guessing that you will suggest I call your customer service number, which I will, but will Nexxus consider bringing the original formula back\n",

      "Please bring back the old formula! I echo the voice of many here. I have used Exxtra Gel for many years. I have straight hair. The old formula helped style my hair and the shine could not be touched by any other brand. I too, would get many compliments. I will use it again. Please, please bring back the old formula. Do you have an ETA\n",

      "I have been using this sculpting gel for over 10 years and have always gotten compliments on how great my thick curly hair was. Strangers would literally stop me to compliment me on my hair and ask what products I use. I would ALWAYS reccomend Nexxus super hold sculpting gel as my must have product. Unfortunately, the formula has been changed and the new one is no where near the original. Since then, I have tried loads of other gels from ridiculously priced high end to drug store specials and have come up disappointed with all of them. Nothing is like the original sculpting gel. Apparently after seeing the overall response to this product, I am clearly not alone on this. I have a tiny bit left of the old formula that I use sparingly for special occasions, this is pathetic lol!! Please bring the old formula back!!!\n",
      "-------\n",
      "I do not know why you changed your extra gel, but it is not the same as the old kind with the other bottle. I have EXTREMELY curly hair and I used that for over 10 years and you all of a sudden you change it!!!!! Please bring it back. The new kind does NOT hold like the other!!!!!I am lost without it!!!!!!\n",

      "Not nearly as good as before. The scent is not good. The gel seems runnier and does not hold as well. Just bring back the old formula!!!! I would switch back if I could get the old gel!!!! For now I have moved on to a better product.\n",

      "I'm a little late to the party, but like many others have been very disappointed with the new formula for the Exxtra Gel. I had used the older formula for 5-10 years and was very happy with it. The new version has a heavy scent and doesn't hold my hairstyle as well. I'm using it only because it is time consuming and expensive to find a replacement. Would much prefer the old formula be reintroduced.\n",

      "I have probably been using Nexxus extra hold for a good 25 years. My favorite was when we could purchase the product in the pump which has been gone for some time now. Recently, I went to buy the renamed exxtra superior hold only to find out the product is discontinued What happened to my good old Nexxus Exxtra Hold gel that gave my hair the wet look and incredible hold The new gel is so potent in smell and just does not offer the same quality that I have become accustom to over the past few decades. Unfortunately it is time to look for an alternate product as the new regime of Nexxus gel's are no longer meeting my needs.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "I have used this gel for several years and loved it. The new formula's scent is awful and the gel doesn't hold my hair like the old formula. I will not buy another tube of this gel. I don't understand why it was changed in the first place.\n",

      "I have been a loyal user of Nexxus Exxtra Gel for 20+ years. I loved it!! I would get compliments on my hair all the time and I have recommended it many times over the years. Nexxus, why did you change a good thing!! The new formula is thinner, has dried out my hair, does not control frizz at all and smells horribly like rubbing alcohol. I feel like I am using hand sanitizer on my hair!! Sadly, I am desperately searching for a new product to use on my hair. The only way I would purchase this product again is if you brought back your old formula.\n",

      "-------\n",
      "The new gel is no where near as good as the old gel. Perhaps its a financial decision to dilute the old gel and get 1.3 -1.5 more bottles out of one of the old thereby generating more revenue, OR perhaps its about a need for a new product yet not offering a market test Either way they DO need to bring the old one back. IN the alternative maybe Nexxus can offer the old gel for sale Online ONLY and see what the consumer preference is\n",
      "-------\n",
      "Like a lot of other customers posts about this product, I do not like the change. I too have used this gel for years and loved it. I was hooked the 1st time I tried it. My hair is thick and naturally curly. I deal with a fair amount of frizz, a daily ordeal and nothing has helped like.Nexxus Gel. Now, I put your gel in my hair and as my hair dries it starts to feel like glue. Once my hair is dry, along with the feel of glue my hair feels like straw. I can't run my hand through my hair. I used to be able to get up the day after I washed my hair and add more gel to control any frizz. Now with the new gel when I try to put more gel in my hair, my hair feels like a stiff gluey mess. Stiff as straw and impossible to comb, even with a wide tooth comb. There's no shine, totally dull and lifeless. I was mortified some one might try to touch my hair. Really gross. I washed it out of my hair and never used it again. I've got half a tube and a full tube sitting in my closet, not being used! Please bring back your old gel! PLEASE!!!! Thank you\n",
      "-------\n",
      "I loved the original formula. My hair was moisturized and shiny when I used it, most importantly the hold was firm but not crunchy. I used the new formula thinking that the bottle was redesigned. I noticed a difference in the formula too when my hair started to frizz. The scent was too much to bear and there was flaking!!! I never experienced flaking with this gel before. Now I must find a new gel or make my own flax seed gel.\n",

      "-------\n",
      "I have used Exxtra Gel since 1988 and it WAS the best gel on the market until earlier in 2015 when you made the mistake of re-formulating it. It is thinner in consistency and doesn't hold nearly as well as the previous formula. Now about the new scent, it is the most horrible smell you could have ever invented! Consider the fact that just as many men use your gel as women do, besides you don't need to add fragrance to styling gel. Men use cologne and women perfume. I have been using gel from one of your competitors, but if you restore your exxtra gel to the previous formula I will return to Nexxus.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "I have used Nexxus EXXTRA Gel for almost 20 years and am very upset that the formula has changed. It does not compare with the old Gel and I don't like the strong smell. Please give us our old formula back. If you don't I have to find something else.\n",

      "-------\n",
      "The original version was a wonderful, dependable product I have used for many, many years and was taken off the market and changed for no good reason when it worked so well. It has a repulsive fragrance and is more watery. I actually had to rewash my hair 30 minutes after using it because I could not bear the fragrance. Extremely disappointed and don't know what I will do now after all these years using the Exxtra Gel as it previously was marketed.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "As I'm sure you know by now, and comments by your company indicate, you will be bringing back the old formula because the vast majority of folks thinks your new version is terrible and unless this is changes soon, you will loose decades old customers including myself.

Nexus Exxtra gel has been my/the ONLY gel that I have used or would use in more than 30 years...though the packaging has changed over the past 30+ years, the formula has ALWAYS remained true until now. Beleive me, it was perfect and you really should go back!!! The ORIGINAL formula was a great consistency to apply, superior hold, no flaking when combed out and absolutely no heavy build up....even after several days of use....NONE! My hair has always been important to me and my one TRIED and TRUE gel has changed. PLEASE change back.... When something is perfect, you don't change....read the hundreds and soon to be thousands of other reviews on this change.... Everyone hates the new stuff. I'm a 30 year veteran of your original product and hate the new stuff....you know it's not the same as soon as you apply it in your hands!\n",

Besides I used to get so many compliments with the old formula now I just look like a frizz ball!! So sad!!\n",

      "Like most others with curly hair it's near impossible to find the perfect product or combination of products to control the frizz and not kill your curl. The old version was awesome, smelled good and worked great with only small amounts needed. Who in the world changed it Did you use a focus group of actual customers The new product is terrible, doesn't do anything for my hair, is thin and smells terrible (like an old lady coming from the beauty parlor). For the love of all that's right, change it back PLEASE!!! 240 out of 270 reviewers hate it, I can't think of a better reason to go back to the original! Listen to your loyal customers Nexxus, or you'll lose them.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "I loved the old formulation of this product. It was absolutely perfect. The shine, the stylability, the glossy, shiney finish. This newer version is stickier to work with, has a duller finish and the fragrance is more perfumey now instead of the previous cleaner, fresher scent. I am so disappointed that you discontinued making the other earlier - more perfect gel.\n",

      "I have been using Nexxus Extra Gel since the 80's....back when it was sold in salons. I have course, thick, curly hair and am also a professional hair stylist. I have tried tons of professional gels over the years and never found one that kept my curls nice and controlled fritz the way the OLD NEXXUS FORMULA did. The new formula is HORRIBLE!!! My hair is lifeless, frizzy and dull. I have also noticed my scalp itches quite a bit which I have never experienced before, but am unsure if the new formula could be causing it or not. PLEASE! Go back to the old formula! You had a great product for thick, curly hair! Most gels out there are so watery and are not compatible with that hair type. So many companies cater to normal or fine hair types, it is ridiculous. After reading so many of the reviews I am hoping you honor your loyal customers requests and go back to the old formula! If you want to change anything on the old formula you could change the scent... it smells more masculine. A more sweet, fresh scent would be nice.... but using the old formula!\n",
      "-------\n",
      "Completely unusable. I have used this for the last 10 yrs, but needed to switch to another product.

I have switched to a Redken, but would switch back in a minute if they brought back the old product.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "As others have stated, I've used this product for many years and was so happy that it was affordable and did what it said it would. I have very fine thin hair and this was just the ticket for getting some texture and hold. Why do companies have to fix what ain't broke I can only assume it has to do with cheaper ingredients. This makes me sad!\n",

      "I used to use the Nexxus Exxtra Gel all the time before they changed to product and added fragrance. The gel did not hold up well anymore and my hair smelled like a woman kind of hard to use it when your man. Wish they still had the old non fragranced gel.\n",

      "A couple years ago I tried the Nexxus Exxtra Gel and it was the best gel I had ever used. I was an instant fan and became a loyal customer of this and some of the other Nexxus products. I would brag about Nexxus anytime a stylist asked me to try something different. Unfortunately I'm no longer a fan after having bought two bottles of the newly formulated Nexxus Exxtra Gel. The new formula is now the worst gel I have ever used and I'm upset that the new prettier packaging didn't bother to advertise they changed the formula. I bought the first bottle and thought someone must have tampered with it because it smelled like baby oil. when I bought the second bottle I realized that the formula really had been changed to one that seemed watered down and cheap. It has turned me away from the Nexxus product line I once bragged about and my stylists are happy that I'm buying different brands from them again.\n",

I have thick dry curly hair and the original product made it look so nice and natural. I was always stopped by other curley women who wanted to know my secret. I would apply it on wet hair and twirl my curls. Once dried, the hair wasnt stiff like in other products and it really looked great for at least two days. The new products is hard to apply it doesnt sculpt and stays frizzy. I have to use a lot more to maintain some shape to the curls. Once it dries, my curls feel stiff and they look dead and lackluster. I am so disappointed. Why did Nexus feel the need to change a good product I loved it. I didnt even mention the yucky smell because that is the least of my problems. I wont continue using this product that is for sure.\n",

      "I have used Nexxus Exxtra Gel for years and just purchased a new tube. I am very disappointed in the new product. It has made my hair oily and I do not like the scent. I will be looking for a replacement product on my next shopping trip. I can't imagine why you changed something that was so good to begin with. Also, the new tube has a lot more ingredients than my old tube. Please go back to the original recipe.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "The previous product (Exxtra Gel) worked great, but now the new product (the same brand as before) does not work at all, the strength of which is not enough to hold the hair style. Can you tell me the difference\n",

      "Simply put, the new product does not work. Have been a loyal customer for years but will have to switch. This was a big mistake in changing the formula as you will definitely lose long-term customers. I hope you reconsider your decision and bring the old formulation back.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "I had been using the old formula for a great number of years an loved it. The new formula is thinner, has a stronger fragrance which competes with my cologne and has less hold. I can't image why Nexxus would find this to be an improvement. NOT a good move. I want my old product back!!!\n",

      "This gel used to be great. They recently reformulated it and it is a very different product with the same name. At first, I figured they just updated the packaging, but as soon as I squirted some out, the difference was obvious. It looks different, smells different, and behaves very differently in your hair. Honestly, they should have just said that they were discontinuing the product and came up with a new name for it. The ingredients are not the same. I don't know what they were thinking.Personally, I have curly/wavy hair and I don't find that this stuff holds up throughout the day. Especially on humid days, when my hair just looks poofy. I am currently trying to find a new hair gel that I like as much as the old version of this product. I will not be buying this product again, unfortunately.\n",

      "I have used Nexxus Exxtra for more than 10 years (even after it was discontinued). So when I saw it back on the market, I had to get it. this new gel is not as thick as the original which is better for today's softer more pliable looking hair. The problem is that the scent is so strong that it makes me not want to use it.\n",

Then it disappeared from my local drugstores for awhile then reappeared in a new peach-colored tube. I'm really disappointed in the new version. The scent is terrible and much too strong. The body, hold, and control I got from the previous version was far superior. And to make matters worse, the tube split along the side during the third use. Now I'm looking for another brand. Why did you have to mess with such a great product!\n",

      "Dear Nexxus: I have used your Exxtra Gel, Superior Hold for several years, sold in the tan colored tube. Within the last 6 months or so, the packaging has changed to the copper colored tube, and the gel is different as well. It is less thick and does not hold as well. I was in a store recently and managed to find the older version. It reaffirms my contention that this new formula is not as effective as the old one. Please bring it back!!!\n",
      "-------\n",
      "I've been using the original product for around 15 years. I saw the new packaging and thought it was just marketing, however the formula has changed too. I apply this product to my hair before it fully dries, now with the new thinner formula all the hold is gone by the time my hair is dry. Its as if it is mainly alcohol and evaporates away. Hopefully Nexxus will quickly change the formula back due to all the bad reviews, or I will be looking for a new gel product.\n",

They looked exactly the same, so I wanted to see how they compared, and I'm glad I did. Upon installing these bulbs in various fixtures around the house, I have noticed that every one of the Feit bulbs flicker - reacting to the slightest frequencies. Initially, I attempted to just put up with it, because they were cheap, but now it has become increasingly irritating. In comparison, the Phillips LED bulbs I purchased have a warmer white light, and they also do not flicker. So yes, the extra few cents I saved by going for these cheap Fiet bulbs - definitely NOT worth it. Go for quality, not quantity.\n",

It has virtually no smell at all... to the point where I wonder if I got a bad batch or something Just a very faint plasticky soap smell. There's nothing impressive or rejuvenating about the way it works either. Doesn't exactly dry out my skin, doesn't really moisturize it either. Seems like a product from the 99 store. Also, the pop top on the bottle doesn't work so I have to unscrew the whole top to use it.\n",

I applied more and more with each use and more often throughout the day but it never made a difference. My hands were getting so bad they were cracking and bleeding. I've resorted to another brand entirely and use it only once a day and the change and improvement in my skin was instant and fixed my damaged broken skin in under a week.

As it is, Tyler Perry is awful as the lead. Every scene with him speaking made me cringe. I knew this movie was a throw away when I read a producer's quote (after switching from Idris to Tyler) that said, \"if you can get Will Smith or Tyler Perry, you do it\"... Like Perry is in the same league as Will Smith when it comes to mass market, big budget films. Yes, he's had a fair amount of success, but in a very narrow range of film types.\n",

      "I'm not one to write online reviews, but I am so sadly disappointed in the new formula that I had give the Clear company feedback. I've used the Clear shampoo for normal hair ever since it first hit shelves. I absolutely loved it. For years I was complimented on my extra long hair and asked what shampoo I used. I stopped using any other styling products because my hair didn't need them anymore. I didn't get a haircut for over 2 years, and when I finally went to cut off 14 inches, my hairdresser said, I can't believe how incredibly healthy your hair is after two years without a cut! And then the new formula came out and everything changed. I'm incredibly disappointed in the new formula. My scalp has never felt more oily. Now I blowout my hair at 8am and by 10am it's greasy looking and feels weighed down at the scalp. I actually went out and got a dry shampoo to use in the afternoons because I cant stand the oily feeling on my scalp any longer. I have searched the internet and I've yet to find one positive review of the new formula from other loyal users. I also can't find any explanation of the new formula, what it is, how it is different, why you changed it, other than a blog post New year, New clear. Unfortunately I'll no longer be using what was once a fantastic product, and I'm now in the miserable process of looking for a new shampoo.\n",

It cleared up my scalp, left my hair shiny, and smelled fantastic. I was impressed because it cleared up my scalp without using the main ingredients in other dandruff shampoos. Now I guess I have to go on a hunt for the old formula and stock up or you just lost yet ANOTHER customer!!!! My only guess is the new formula is cheaper and you get to sell it for the same price. What ever happened to quality products..\n",

The second time I used this shampoo, my hair felt waxy, dry, and porous when I rinsed it out of my hair. I then read the full list of ingredients and saw that it had tallow acid in it, which is made from animal fat. No wonder my hair felt waxy.

      "My daughter and I have been using the Clear Shampoo and the Clear Conditioners for about 2 years now. Smells great and makes our hair feel soft. However, every few weeks we have had to switch to an alternate shampoo and conditioner for a few days as the Clear would make our scalps itchy. We both were seeing a lot of hair in the drain catcher with every shampooing with the Clear products but just chalked it up to the fact that we both have longer, wavy hair. About a week and a half ago we decided to try something different that a sales clerk suggested. We have been using Paul Mitchell Lavender and Mint shampoo and conditioner and have found we are only losing very few strands of hair with each washing. This leads me to the conclusion that the large amounts of hair in the drain while using the Clear was NOT a normal amount of hair loss! It was caused by the Clear. I will NOT be buying their products again nor do I recommend their products to others.\n",

To my sheer joy, Clear worked!! My scalp healed, my hair looked great, and I never tried another shampoo or conditioner. Since the new formula my scalp has started having a reaction. I didn't think it was an even a new formula, only a redesigned label, when I bought the new formula. My scalp had a very mild reaction, which I could deal with if my hair didn't look greasy and weighed down after 12 hours of using the shampoo. I noticed a change immediately when I dried my hair after my first wash. It's like this formula is for dry hair. I've stuck with it to see if my hair would adjust and maybe it was all in my head, but the breakouts and greasy hair persist after at least 2 weeks of use. I am so disappointed. I have a travel size of the old formula that I am debating when to use, but don't want to use up at the same time (totally irrational I know)\n",

I found it harder and harder to find and my local stores and when I did find it I noticed right off it wasn't the same. I have flakes all in my hair and red bumps all in my scalp.

      "My first problem is I can not find your product anywhere, my second problem is the stuff I can find is this new 24/7 garbage, and I'm sorry for my language but I do mean it. The fragrance is atrocious and nauseating I have very sensitive allergies and can not tolerate the new formula. Your original formula was the only thing that helped my hair. You see I also have Hashimotos, a thyroid condition where hair loss is one of the many side affects of the disease. Since I have stopped using your ORIGINAL formula I have noticed a significant difference in the amount of hair that falls out and it's starting to worry me. I know many woman that have bald spots from this disease, and don't want to end up wearing wigs. I am sitting here crying, I beg you PLEASE bring back the original Clear Scalp and Hair Conditioner, Strong Lengths Shampoo, Strong lengths formula, please, please, please...\n",

      "I loved this shampoo/conditioner when it first came out. It made my hair soft and silky and I could go 2 days without washing (I have super oily hair). Now my hair is greasy and tends to flake. BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULA! This one even smells different!\n",

      "I had been using the Clear Strong Lengths formula for about 4 years and it was the only shampoo and conditioner I have ever stuck to...It somehow worked a miracle for my hair! Then all of a sudden I couldn't find it anywhere and I would go to different stores and finally I found it with a new label and thought oh they just changed the packaging.. After the first use I was very disappointed. The old formula smelled and worked so much better! I really hope you consider making the old formula available again.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "After reading the other reviews, I can now see that Clear has changed its formula, and I now know this is the reason for my scalp trouble. The original formula and scent were AMAZING! I have very dry and damaged hair from repeated coloring and bleaching sessions. But you could never tell because of how beautifully the old formula worked! For years, I had soft, smooth hair, the scent was pleasant, and this shampoo blew away all the others, even the expensive salon brands I've used in the past. The shampoo alone worked well enough to keep my hair at its best, even without conditioner! After using the new formula, I've got excessively oily hair, and painful sebum plugs deep in my scalp. This is horrible. I'm still trying out many different shampoos to see if I can soothe my scalp and control the oiliness. Clear, you had a great thing going... Why mess with a perfect product\n",

      "If any of you are experiencing the same disappointment as me, PLEASE take just one minute of you time to call clear care consumer services at 1800-372-6389 and let them know how they messed up . I have been using clear total care shampoo and conditioner for years and loved it, and now since they changed the ingredients it has totally changed the condition of my hair. It's now dry at the ends, doesn't nourish my scalp and leaves my hair weighed down looking oily!! Please. Ring back the original formula!! I have tried all the new clear lines and none even come close to how your guys product use to work. If anyone else is experiencing the same issue please call in to report it. Hopefully we can have the Original line brought back.. ughhhh now I need to find a new shampoo and conditioner until then .\n",

      "I used the original total care shampoo for a few years and I loved it. I got compliments on the look, feel, and scent of my hair daily, by far the best shampoo I and my family have ever used. Sadly that formula is replaced by a new and terrible formula. My hair now is greasy, not shiny, not soft, full of dandruff, heavy, and my hair now does not have that incredible smell that it used to have. I love my hair, but now I do not know what to do to help it because the old shampoo was perfect and now my hair is left to die with this new one. I have not seen anyone who likes this new shampoo. So please bring back the old formula, the non-24/7 total care. I used to recommend your shampoo all the time and I do not understand why you got rid of a beautiful gift to the world. I want to stay loyal to Clear, but you are making it very hard to do so by taking away all of your good products. And I do not know how much longer my hair and scalp can take this new formula because my hair now feels like it's dying.\n",

      "Used to religiously buy and used this product with the old forma. The way it made my hair feel and look was amazing. The scents were sooo pleasant.

Until then I have completely switched brands.\n",

      "-------\n",
      "I wanted to try the new formula before I took the word of the other reviews. The other reviews are CORRECT! The new formula is nothing like the old---my hair felt dry after I rinsed out the shampoo--I have a little of the original formula left so I washed my hair right away to see if there was a difference--AND THERE IS! Before I started using the original formula my hair was thin, stringy, dry and falling out. I have been using the original formula for a few years now and my hair is thicker, shiny, healthy and full! Please bring back the original formula!!!!!!!!!!! I don't want my hair to get thin, dry and stringy again!\n",

      "What happened I used to love Clear Shampoo because of how amazing it smelled and how light it made my hair. Now it smells so bad. Coconut doesn't even do anything. The formula is way too thick and made my hair feel really gross. PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULA!\n",

      "I absolutely loved your original formula Stronger Lengths shampoo and conditioner. My whole family used it, and we all loved the smell and feel of our hair. My hair smelled great ALL DAY! Since you stopped selling it, I tried to switch to 24/7 Total Care, and I'm so disappointed. The smell is not as good or as long-lasting, and it doesn't seem to work as well. Please bring back your original formulas - I miss my Stronger Lengths!!!!\n",

      "I swore by this shampoo and conditioner - it made my hair smooth - I could run a comb through it after washing without any struggle it was silky and wonderful - I would get compliments daily on how great my hair smelled. New formula is AWFUL! I have been on the hunt for something new because I can't continue to use this new formula - makes my hair greasy and heavy. Please let me know if you bring back the old stuff and i'll return!\n",

      "I used to love clear. I have very oily hair and it used to help controlling it. When I went to my local big box and saw that they changed bottle and read that it was a new scent I thought I should buy a smaller bottle to see if I like the scent first. GOOD THING I DID! The smell is totally different, it doesn't control my oil anymore and it doesn't give me the body like it used to. I told everyone about clear when I first used it and liked it. Now, I am not so confident about recommending it. Please bring back the old formula and scent! I really don't like this new one.\n",

      "I have been using Clear products for over 3 years. All my friends and family know that I swear by this shampoo/conditioner, and they have all gotten several recommendations from me to use these products. But after using the new formula and the new scent , I am going to sadly discontinue purchasing your products. I absolutely hate the new scent. It does not smell clean or fresh and the scent doesn't last. For the first time in over 3 years, my hair smells like hair! It also doesn't do anything for my hair, as far as helping with frizz or shine. I am so disappointed. Why would you change a good thing I mean, you guys were given a Allure Best of Beauty Award Winner, for pete's sake!\n",
      "-------\n",

      "My holy grail shampoo and conditioner was Clear with the original scent and formula. It smelled AMAZING and lasted very long on my hair. I always received compliments about how my hair smelled so great. It left my hair very soft and shiny as well. So it used to be my dream shampoo and haven't used anything else. However, when I saw in stores that they changed the formula and scent, I was upset but still wanted to give it a try. I'm very disappointed and saddened that my favorite shampoo is gone and that this new formula is a complete disappointment. Why was there a need to changed the formula when it was perfect Now my hair doesnt smell as good (has a coconut like scent, which I am not a fan of) and it leaves my hair looking dull. Please bring back the old formula!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now I'm on the search for a new shampoo and conditioner. So sad.\n",

      "I used to absolutely love this shampoo conditioner! My favorite part was the smell! It was phenomenal! I would get compliments on my hair everyday saying my hair smelt delicious! When I purchased this new formula I was so Dissappointed. The scent was completely different, and as a woman with oily hair, this product weighed my hair down. I will not be repurchasing this product again. Now on the search for a new, great-smelling shampoo.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "I must have found his gem right before they changed the formula like everyone in the 1-star section has mentioned. When I first discovered Clear, I felt like I had finally found my dream shampoo. There was no weight after I washed my hair. It was extremely healthy feeling and looking, and it smelled AMAZING. That is a thing of the past. Around March of this year, y'all must've launched your new formula, because my hair has been awful ever since. It feels greasy even after I style it, an hour or two after it has been washed. I had to buy clarifying shampoo to use to remove the buildup that your product has left on my hair. I would love to be a customer, but this new formula is bad, and I'm not the only one saying it. Please listen to your customers and bring back the old formula so we can all go back to having wonderful looking, and smelling, hair!\n",
      "-------\n",

      "Not a fan of the new formula, and particularly despise the new scent. This was the only shampoo conditioner I purchased for the past 4 years, and would have continued to do so if they hadn't changed it. I never write reviews but felt compelled to in hopes they would bring back the original. Until that happens, I'm forced to shop for a different brand because formula aside, I honestly can't stand the scent of the new shampoo conditioner.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "I've been a clear lover for a while now, it was the only shampoo I bought because it didn't give me dandruff and the biggest reason I bought was because it smelt AMAZING! Everything was perfect (p.s I used only strong lengths shampoo and conditioner) until no store sells them anymore and they only sell the newer 24/7 bottles and I just can't stand the new smell..They've lost me as a customer because of this. :/\n",
      "-------\n",
      "As a long time user of this shampoo I was extremely disappointed to find the new formula is unusable for me. The old formula had a fantastic scent that was light and clean. Certain flowery scents give me migraines, so scent is a big factor for me in hair products. The new version is heavily scented and intolerable for me. The old formula left my hair clean, shiny, and manageable. Two days of the new formula left my hair heavy and greasy. Please bring back the old formula, otherwise you've lost a customer. :-(\n",

People would often ask me what I was wearing that smelled so good and I would always reply with a smile It's my hair. Then I purchased this new formula and scent and instantly noticed the difference. My hair was weighted down and looked greasy and there was no beautiful scent. I've switched shampoos since and can't seem to find one that makes my hair look as good or smell as good as this shampoo once did. PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD SCENT AND FORMULA. PLEASE!!!!\n",

I don't buy this anymore, still in search of something that works as good as this used to.\n",

      "This product looked soooo good, so I decided to try the 2 dollar sample shampoo. Good thing I didn't buy the whole thing because it made my hair so oily, dry and just felt gross. It might only be my hair, since other people seemed to have liked it, but I hate it. The one thing I do like is that it has a very good fragrance, but I wouldn't use it again. My hair actually looked oilier than before I had washed it.\n",

      "I used to love this shampoo until you changed the formula. I don't care for the new scent, almost smells musty. My hair doesn't feel as clean with this new formula.

I previously recommended this old one to my daughter and she promptly returned her purchase to me! My hair is over greasy with oily build up, and I am washing it constantly. Flat top is not something to be pleased about!\n",
      "-------\n",
      "This new formula is not anywhere near as good as the old. The old left my hair smelling great and so shiny and soft for 4-5 days. The new formula softens my hair but not as much as the old and it does smell good after freshly washed but by the end of the next day, smells as if it was not washed for days and is knotted and dry on the ends. Also I was very limited on the type of shampoo/conditioner I could use as some of the new formulas contain algae, cactus, or berry extract all of which I am allergic too, so maybe this hair type shampoo/conditioner is wrong for my hair type, but was the only one I had to choose from due to allergens. I used the old formula for 4 years and it was the only thing that made my hair beautiful and grew from very short to extremely long using the old formula and it was healthy. The new formula doesn't seem to benefit my hair nearly as much. Sad to say but I will no loner be using this product in this formula, please bring back the old formula.\n",

Why is there no longer a Volumizing Shampoo and Conditioner The best shampoo I've ever used and it gets taken away. I had never received more compliments on my natural hair than when I was using the Clear Volumizing shampoo and conditioner. REALLY disappointed and would love if you could bring that back. For someone with fine, shiny hair, we dont need moisture, hydration. I have tried the color and heat conquerer and my hair never got fully clean and the scent is no longer desirable. HELP! BRING BACK THE BEST SHAMPOO EVER! I will buy it for life. My reviews will be of the current product line as is. This review would be the complete opposite, had the old formula not gone away.\n",

      "When I started using Clear shampoo and conditioner I loved it. My hair felt softer and smoother. After a couple weeks, though, I started to notice some flakes. I have never had dandruff in my entire life so this freaked me out a little bit. The only thing in my hair care routine I had changed was the shampoo and conditioner, so I figured it was that, but wasn't absolutely positive. I stopped using it and used Head Shoulders for a few weeks before going back to my regular shampoo. Immediately my hair went back to normal (and was flake-free). After a couple months I decided to try Clear again, since I had a lot left. After about three days I started to get flakes again. My hair is on the dry side, so maybe this makes sense, but as I mentioned, this is the first shampoo/conditioner I have ever tried that caused flakes.\n",

My purpose here, though, is not to tout a great movie, but blast Lion's Gate for releasing such a poor quality product. I own a good collection of Blu-Ray movies and they all look great on my 1080p Mitsubishi on a PS3. Stargate, however, looks like they ripped a VHS cassette tape and put it on a Blu-Ray disk. Sad. So, for my opinion, I say that your money is better spent on the DVD version. It will be cheaper and look the same.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "The \"extended cut\" looks great. The original cinematography was wonderful. The original music at times gets a bit repetitive, but I imagine that not many people have John Williams talent. Regardless, the most annoying thing about this version is the complete lack of subtitles for the many foreign languages spoken (German, \"ancient Egyptian\", etc). The only way to get any subtitling (and still much of the subtitles is not there) is to turn on either the English or Spanish subtitles. On the DVD I rented, the subtitles were there just for the foreign languages, leaving the English un-subbed. It wouldn't be so bad, except that this is a Blu-Ray, for which you're paying extra. You expect a little bit of continuity between the movies on different formats. I say, stick with the standard DVD version.\n",

      "True fans of 'Stargate' will want to bypass this Blue-Ray disc and stick with the much better 2-disc special edition dvd that came out several years ago, had both the theatrical and director's cuts of the film, as well as several bonus features oddly not seen here on this new so-called 'next generation' release.\n",

      "When someone slaps the word BABY on a product, you assume it's baby friendly! I just went through the fiasco of a SCREAMING baby because it is not eye gentle! Every mom knows how hard it is to wash something out of a baby's eyes! Washing made it even worse because when you wash it, it starts acting like soap and gets worse! How is a baby supposed to go swimming and/or sweat without this stuff washing into their eyes ADVERTISING MILD AS WATER IS SUCH A LIE! Last time I checked, water didn't burn my eyes unless it was chlorine or salt water! Either case, false advertising! Granted, there is a tiny section on the back that said to keep out of eyes. I don't know about you, when you have a squirming child... You hardly take the time to read the back carefully unless you so happen to be next to the darn bottle while using the bathroom. However, in this case, I didn't go squirting sunscreen in my child's eyes or run it near the eyes. I simply applied the lotion on his face (as recommended by doctors) and any EXPOSED BODY PARTS which in turn, includes his HANDS. Which makes sense unless a parent plans on sending a child out with gloves at all seasons of the year! I admit to poor judgement on my part on not thinking it through clearly. However, as I mentioned earlier on, when one slaps the words baby and mild as water, one assumes it is gentle for ALL PARTS OF THE BABY including the EYES! I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND! However, I can make sound judgement that as far as skin use, it is gentle... But after dealing with a screaming baby and struggling to wash it out for 10 minutes, then having the baby fall asleep after the fiasco because of exhaustion, followed by having to wait an additional hour before continuing my plans, I would say this product is an inconvenience to have. It wasn't even his nap time! My suggestion is to do more research and find a better product that is truly baby safe, in all spectrums worthy of using the label BABY. Truly, One PO'ed and Distressed Mother\n",

After a couple applications, we realized the eye watering only occured when we applied the sunscreen. Turns out it was stinging her skin so she was rubbing her face and then her eyes making them water! The eyes stopped watering when we changed brands. Do not recommend!\n",

The claim that this is as gentle as water is a complete fabrication - we use so many Aveeno products in our home because of skin sensitivities and I was very let down by this product and upset I had relied on this company I trusted to tell us the truth that this was specifically formulated for babies.

However, my sister DID end up being allergic to it even though it says 'gentle as water'. This isn't a big deal to the two of us being that I just took it off her hands and use it as a normal sunblock, but I would NOT rub this on a baby. My sister got totally red from it.

      "Ordered a glider ottoman for my nursery, it took almost a month to arrive! Once it arrived the box was left outside the front door and it was clearly burnt. We opened it up and found that the fabric on the glider and ottoman was also burnt. Not sure where the fire was or why they bothered to deliver the damaged item. We had to arrange for ups to pick up the item for return and get a refund. Purchased the item from Babies R Us instead due to the HUGE inconvenience.\n",

      "I have had this set for eight months in my baby's room since we brought him home. With in a couple of months the squeeking started which was fixable with wd40. Now this glider is out of control skreetching with a big bump in the middle of the glide. It is really irratating when all you need to do is sit and rock your upset baby. So now we are waiting for our new rocker not a glider to be delivered. We search and found that even some of the expensive gliders have the same complaints which is why we are going with a rocker. Good Luck!\n",

      "my husband purchased this product for me to use for nursing..it was easy to put together and only took about 20-30 minutes tops. it's a very beautiful chair and the colors are great. i was really impressed at first especially for the price. it did smell funny at first, but nothing fabreeze can't fix and i'm sure the rubbery smell would wear off after a couple weeks. HOWEVER the quality was very poor.. after only 2 days the chair broke! the first time my husband sat in it the chair made a creeking sound, but we figured it was breaking in since it was brand new and didn't think much of it. the next day when he sat in it and glided it made a loud pop and the bottom bars that glide broke. i wouldn't recommend this product it is very pretty, but not worth it and a waste of your money. i guess you get what you pay for. our local walmart did return it, but save you time and money and don't go through the hassle of having to take it apart and taking it back to the store.\n",

      "This chair was nice when it was first purchased. My daughter was only two weeks old and the chair started to squeek! Now not only does it squeek, but there is a loud clunking sound and it isn't a gentle soothing glider! WD 40 will not work when the squeek is wood on wood...try baby powder! But only a quick not permant fix. I WOULD NEVER recommend this product to someone with a baby! Also not enough room for your arms and baby for nursing. I don't hardly use it anymore because of those reasons...it was a WASTE of money.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "When we originally got the Glider we were impressed by the color and the padding and such. Required minimal installation but we have regretted this purchase soon after. The glider squeaks so much that it is unbearable to use. No matter how much of WD40 we use it doesn't help. I would not recommend this Glider and we are going to purchase a Dutalier or a better glider soon.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "Walmart did a great job, they deliver before the arrival time and the customer service was great, but i didn't like the glider and ottoman. The quality of the product is nice and well done, but it is really uncomfortable for me. You have to sit very straight......So, unfortunately I have returned this product 2 days after I received it.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "Ok, I've waited over a year to write this review. I purchased this chair 12/2009 and have been using it since then about 5-8 times a day. This chair is a decent wood and a decent fabric. The cushions are pretty comfortable actually. The chair is SUPER easy to put together. If you're mechanically inclined you can do it yourself. Others may need assistance from a second person. Fairly easy to wipe down the fabric (covers are not removable). I have fallen asleep in it with my daughter in my arms prior to the squeaking issue starting, so it is really a fairly comfortable chair. What I didn't like: 6-12 weeks after I purchased this chair I started to have a lot of squeaking coming from the bottom bearings of the gliding portion of the chair. This might not be a huge deal for some people, but it's very loud. Especially, loud when you're trying to nurse a sleepy baby back to sleep and it keeps waking them up. I tried to adjust all of the bolts, tried WD-40, didn't fix the issue. I finally contacted customer service at Storkcraft after about 7 months of owning it. They did agree to send me a replacement base for the chair since it was still within the 12 month warranty period. Oh, and I am of normal height and weight, so being over a weight limit is not an issue. Upon receipt I removed the old base, attached the new base exactly as the instructions stated. Again, about 8 weeks after receiving this base I had the same problem. I let it go for about 12 weeks and contacted Storkcraft again just to let them know I was having issues again (even though I was now out of the warranty period). They said that they would as a courtesy send me another base, but any future bases would be at a charge to me. Which of course makes sense. I told them I wasn't expecting another base, just trying to inform them that the problem was not resolved and that maybe there's an issue with the production of the item. I have received the third base (second replacement) and have not installed it yet. I would like to say that this would be a good chair if it didn't have this obnoxious squeaking issue. However, to me that makes the chair almost not usable. It squeaks every single time I rock in it. So I really wouldn't recommend this chair because of the issues I had with it. I did think that everything else about it was fairly nice and definitely worth the price. But that's why I gave it a (2) star rating. Because I wasn't completely dissatisfied(1), but I wasn't neutral on it (3), nor was I happy(4) or ecstatic(5) about it. I read all of the reviews before I bought it and thought it was a good choice, so I thought I'd give my feedback for you to look over as well. Good luck in your decision!\n",
      "-------\n",
      "I purchased this item because of the high ratings it received. It is a beautiful chair to look at and it's really inviting but, it is very hard on my back. I thought it was just me but my daughter also found it to be too hard to sit in to watch a 1 1/2 hour movie. Do not buy this chair if you intend to use it for sitting in for long periods at a time.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "We've had this glider for just under a year. I wish I would have saved my money for a more expensive set because the quality is just not there - it feels shaky, squeaks, the padding is rather thin, and it just not that comfortable, especially when you have to sit down for longer feedings. It also doesn't work for a taller person - my husband could not sit in it comfortably with our baby. The ottoman also did not work the best for comfortably propping up feet up - it seemed too low and would not stay in place. We ended up just not using it. The glider does the job, but is overall a disappointment.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "The chair was easy to assemble was a great piece for our living room. I loved rocking my baby to sleep until it started squeaking never stopped. The sound is so annoying won't go away.\n",

      "product says 'cocoa butter solid'. what a joke- the first 3 ingredients are mineral oil, petrolalum, and parrafin. in fact according to the label, it has more fragrance in it than cocoa butter. It even contains corn oil !! I could have saved myself some money and time by buying a cheap candle and rubbing it on. Label shows a picture of a cocoa bean - it should have shown an oil rig and ear of corn !!! no wonder they don't show the ingredients in the ad - not even on the manufacturer's website.shame on Amazon for even allowing it to be catagorized with real cocoa butter products.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "*Edited to add that the pictures of the ingredients label were not on the page when I bought this product.*This is by no means solid coca butter. It has *some* cocoa butter in it but it's a ways down the ingredients list. It is more mineral oil, petroleum. and paraffin which are the first three ingredients. It is very solid, like a candle. In fact, I dumped the tub over accidentally and the whole thing fell out of the tub in one solid piece. I picked it up and put it back in. It looks like a candle, yellow and nearly opaque. It is very greasy and very, very hard. You can't dip your finger into the tub and scoop some out. You have to sort of scrape the sides to get some of the waxy stuff out of there.On my skin, it is greasy. It has a great scent though I must say. I guess it's cocoa buttery. The fragrance is artificial. I bought this cream for my hands as they are really dry in the winter but this is way too greasy for use anytime but at night with gloves on. It does remove makeup on my face decently although it is certainly not my preferred method. It's not bad on my lips but has a strange taste. I am desperately trying to find a use for this stuff. I think that the description should be much clearer because this simply is NOT cocoa butter at all. It is misleading to label it that way. I have been using this Queen Helene .. stuff on my hands at night and also have used it to remove makeup, on my lips, and also around my eyes for a jolt of hydration but really, I don't know quite what to do with it. It is not what I expected and so hard and greasy. At least it was cheap!\n",

      "This product is ridiculous. It indeed holds and sculpts firmly with a matte finish, but good luck getting it out of your hair. Days later and after multiple washes, my poor hair is left feeling tacky and clumpy- stiff like straw. As another review stated, 'stuck with chewing gum' would be a totally accurate comparison. This was my first styling purchase from L'Oreal and I expected so much more from such a leading name in hair care. How disappointing. Never again.\n",

      "I needed something to help style my hair for work(bartender) and this looked like it would be able to keep my hair in one place without me having to adjust it during a shift at work.

So much so that it is impossible to wash off. For that, this first try might be my last if I can't find a way to still get back my clean hair at the end of the day.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "I wanted to rate it as 3 stars but it will not let me. Has a pleasant scent and is easier to rinse than most other powdered scrubs. It did not cut though the tub ring as well as I would have liked. But over all it did a good job on the lighter stuff. It just needs a little extra something added to help with cleaning tuff stuff.\n",

On the contrary I feel like my roots became more oily and my hair and ends became extremely dry! I wasn't too happy with these products. Beware of your hair becoming very tangled!! (If you have curly hair). As far as the conditioner, it smelled kind of good actually and it felt like it conditioned my hair while I applied it in the shower.

      "I would like to start off my thanking Influenster and L'Oral for allowing me to try these products at no cost in exchange for an honest review. I also wanted to note that I have blonde, color treated hair. Please keep in mind that just because a product does/does not work for me, does not mean it will/will not work for you. Different products work very different on different hair/skin types. Inside the VoxBox was a clay pre-shampoo treatment, a shampoo, and a conditioner. It claims that there are three different types of clays in this system, all which work together to keep your ends hydrated and your roots non-greasy for a minimum of 48 hours. I was super excited to try this and have been trying it for a little over a month now. I am sadto say that this treatment did not work for me. With my normal hair care regime, my hair will stay non-greasy for about two days. If I used the clay system in the morning, my hair would be greasy by either that night, or the next morning. So my hair actually got greasy faster than usual. My hair would also be very very flat and lifeless as soon as it dried. I really really wanted to love this system as I wish I could go longer than my normal two days without washing my hair, but unfortunately, it did not work for me. One thing I did love about the system is that it smelled amazing and the smell would last all day. I am sure this system could work for some hair types, but not mine.

      "I received this product free from Influenster for testing purposes, but all opinions are mine. I have the most oily roots and dry ends ever. No product I have used can cure it.

I have long thick hair and the product dried my scalp out when the mask was not applied first. The product, in my opinion doesn't smell the greatest either.

      "-------\n",
      "This was the last step out of the three step process. I will say that this was my least favorite step. The product is designed to take the oil away from your roots and bring moisture to your ends. However, I feel that this brought oil to all of my hair which is why I was left oily later in the day! The smell is great, but I would probably try and use a different conditioner. I received this product free for testing purposes, but all opinions are my own.

      "I have been a big LOral fan, using their products for more than a decade now. For the past three weeks I have been testing the LOral Paris Hair Expert Extraordinary Clay range - the mask, shampoo and conditioner. I have curly hair with a normal scalp. I have been testing all three products during my regular hair care routine, but also just the shampoo and conditioner without the mask. After applying the mask which felt weird on my scalp (hard to apply, tangled up my hair pretty badly), I used the shampoo. This did not help too much. I lost some hairs during the shampooing process. At the end I applied the conditioner to smooth my hair, but my hair looked messy, tangled, not to mention that my curls vanishes, my hair was dry, undefined and I looked like I had a stack of hay on my head. I tried using just the shampoo and conditioner without the mask, same unfortunate effect. I have noticed that after only 48 hours my hair was oily and I had to wash it right away - something that never happened before to me - so quite the opposite effect that I was expecting for. In conclusion, the whole system - mask, shampoo, conditioner - did not work for my hair. I am sure they will work for other hair types out there, but for mine these were just unfortunate. I received these products complimentary for testing purposes, but all my opinions are honest and coming from a period of three weeks of testing. This review was collected as part of a promotion.\n",
      "-------\n",
      "Despite using this with the line's hair mask and shampoo, I didn't find much difference in oil control the next day and still felt the need to use dry shampoo. It smells nice and made my hair feel soft, but it just didn't live up to all of its promises, in my opinion. Such a shame too because I love the concept and really wanted this to work for me!
